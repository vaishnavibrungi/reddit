# **Problem Statement**

* Imagine this scenario: A grumpy backend engineer working at Reddit mistakenly deleted the "subreddit" column in the database in Australia. None of the subreddit links will populate with posts until the subreddit column data is recovered. While Reddit's team is working on restoring the deleted column, they decide to hire outside consultants to build a classification model that will predict which subreddit a random post belongs to. For consultants bidding for the project, Redditâ€™s team is asking for a sample model focusing on only two subreddits rather than all of the subreddits hosted on the site.
* The project objective is  to build  an accurate classification model to predict which subreddit a given post belongs to.
* This project also aims to list down top features of each subreddit that determine where a random post belongs to.

# **Summary**

## violinist Data Cleaning 
* Renamed the column names.
* Column order was changed.
* "Created_utc" which was in  unix/epoch time format was converted  to regular time stamp in UTC.

## cello Data Cleaning 
* Renamed the column names.
* Column order was changed.
* "Created_utc" column which was in  unix/epoch time format was converted  to regular time stamp in UTC.

## reddit_data Data Cleaning 
* Binarized the "subreddit_name" column in the combined data frame.
* Special characters and punctuation were removed and words were  converted to lower-case using tokenizer,words that are minimal to no importance were removed using stop words,and stemming was  used to get the base form of the word.
* Row with missing value in the "post_title" column was dropped.

## **Data Visualization**

* Barcharts were used to analyze the data.
* ROC Curve was plotted to evaluate the model performance.

## **Data Modeling**
We tested each model below under both CountVectorizer and TFI-DF Vectorizer and proceeded with the one that had the better score:
* Logistic Regression
* Multinomial Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Bagging Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Extra Trees Classifier
* GridSearchCV

# **Data**

## **Data Source**
The data was collected by reading from the push shift API on Thursday, June 17, 2021.1000 most recent submissions from each subreddit were taken to conduct the analysis.

## **Data Dictionary**

|      Feature     |       Type      |   Dataset   |                      Description                      |
|:----------------:|:---------------:|:-----------:|:-----------------------------------------------------:|
|     author_id    |      object     | reddit_data |          User Id of the author   of the post          |
|     posted_on    | datetime64[ns]  | reddit_data |                   post creation time                  |
|     author_tag   |      object     | reddit_data | Tags assigned by   author of the posts to themselves  |
|    post_title    |      object     | reddit_data |                   Title of the post                   |
| post_description |      object     | reddit_data |               Description of the   post               |
|  subreddit_name  |       int       | reddit_data |                 Name of the subreddit                 |

# **Conclusion**

* Logistic Regression model under the CountVectorizer has the better accuracy to predict which subreddit a given post belongs to.
* Baseline accuracy rate was 50.7% whereas on test data our model's accuracy rate was 71.4%  which was better than the baseline accuracy and  the error rate of our model was 28.5%.
* The subreddits shared common words like "cello", "violin", "string", "bow", "music" and many others.
* Our Model roc_auc_score is 0.808 which shows that our model can detect more numbers of True positives and True negatives than False negatives and False positives and is able to distinguish between positive and negative class.
* The top ten words that determine whether a post belongs to the Violinist or Cello subreddit according to our model  :

| Violinist 	|      Cello   	|
|:---------:	|:------------:	|
|   violin  	|     david    	|
| violinist 	|     band     	|
|  teacher  	|     often    	|
|    play   	|    weight    	|
|    long   	|    either    	|
|    rest   	| bought first 	|
|  shoulder 	|    hickey    	|
|    keep   	|     singl    	|
|   pleas   	|     talk     	|
|  vibrato  	|     camp     	| 

* The above words make intuitive sense to belong to their respective columns. For example, On the Violinist column, "rest", "shoulder" which stands for shoulder rest, attaches to the back of the violin and rests on the shoulder and collarbone. It makes the violin comfortable to play for long durations, enabling proper posture and preventing injury."vibrato" is a slight fluctuation in pitch that's used to create warmth or richness of tone. On the Cello column, "David" which stands for David Darling who is an American cellist and composer," hickey" is an instore and online music center that sells accessories, music software, and much other music-related stuff, and Cellos usually weigh between 5 and 7 pounds which "weight" is referring to.

# **Next Steps**
For our model we have focussed on only one vectorized feature i.e. post_title column, to predict which subreddit random post belongs to. To fine-tune the model we can :
* Include the vectorized "post_description" column and the "author_tag" column to see which level of players like a beginner, adult, etc. post frequently in both the subreddits.
* Analyze the "created_utc" column to check which subreddit users post frequently.
* Collect more sample data.
* Remove vectorized words that are in the title of the Subreddit.
