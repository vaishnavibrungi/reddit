Adult Beginner,1623804923,o0szzo,"I decided to do something different, this week. Since people have asked about previous practice journal entries, and because it's a pain in the butt to list them all in a post on Reddit, I made a free [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com) blog about it.

I don't intend to do anything with the blog except to track my practice and make it easier to link to practice journal entries.

Let me know whether you like this, or not. I haven't really used WordPress much, so I have already screwed up the home page. Hopefully, I'll get it figured out and fixed, eventually.

I've only been at this for a little over a year so I'm still a complete newbie. I'm having this issue where anything I play on G has a weird raspy sound that accompanies it. It's not the amount of rosin I don't think because I thoroughly clean the strings after every practice and I try to be cognizant of rosining the bow. I've also tried playing on a different violin and I still get this ambient raspy sound with anything I play on that string leading me to think it's my technique. I don't have this issue with the other three strings and I can occasionally get a half decent tone out of them and when I do it's glorious (this is after months of EVERYTHING sounding like I'm bowing with a Brillo pad so it's progress). I've been trying to do a lot of G scales to see if I can figure this out but so far haven't had much success. Is this just another thing that'll eventually click? Or is there a trick to the G string that I may want to try? Thanks in advance.

,1623631502,nzah9a,"Hi! So I ended up needing to get a different violin teacher for the upcoming year. I had been with my last one for about 2 years, and the one before that for 2-3 years. I have a new teacher lined up, and the first lesson with them is tomorrow. I got to thinking, I don't really know how to go about finding a good fit for a teacher. The last 2 I had were basically just ones that were available for the time slot I needed. The first one was really great and solidified a lot of good technique early on, so I havnt had many issues since starting my violin journey. They stressed the importance of metronome work and playing well slowly before increasing speed. I was really upset when they were no longer available. The second one seemed a bit scatter brained and I was always having to remind them what we had been working on previously (is this normal?) They were really friendly, although they didn't really offer much feedback aside from saying that my playing sounded very nice. It was rare that they offered much technical feedback i.e. how to practice certain passages, play with a metronome, etc. There were also a lot of times when they would get distracted and go off on tangents about their personal life. We never really had a specific lesson plan or goal outside of getting to the next song in the Suzuki book and picking a random etude to work on. It didn't annoy me enough to switch teachers, but was still annoying none the less... this time around I would really like to find a more goal oriented teacher.

Basically what I'm asking is are there any questions I should be asking my teacher at our initial lesson(s). I'm not really sure how much I should be expecting from them. Like should I expect them to have some sort of lesson plan? Or should it be kind of winging it like my last teacher... Any insight would be greatly appreciated! Lessons aren't exactly cheap, so I mostly just want to make sure I'm getting my money's worth and not settling. Thanks for reading if you got this far!!",violinist,Getting A New Teacher,,1

Abit about myself:  
Im 30y old and been playing and studying since age 5. It has been a roller coaster of a ride as a violinist.  
I began playing the violin because I got interested from watching tv, the bow stroking a string, and out comes beautiful sound made me interested i think. Not that I knew what i was going into but my parents at that time asked me if I wanted to play the violin . And so I began my journey.  
Got into a school with the help of my parents, we got private lessons and I had a russian teacher for 14 years(up until highschool). In short from here, i have a bachelor, master and master soloist degree in switzerland and have been freelancing and made recordings in projects both chamber music and chamberorchestras around central europe.  


Now, Ive been unmotivated and felt really unhappy to work as a violinist last 4 years and looking for other alternatives. Ive been told my whole life that im the violinist ''taleneted'' here and there, but im just fed up with the violin somehow. Its a big decision for sure for me so i told myself ill think about this 1-2 weeks and think what other options might be out there.

Is buying a bow much like buying a violin, should I try out different bows before buying them or can I order it online?

Do the different materials in bows make a difference in the tone/control? Brazilwood vs carbon fiber vs pernambuco? I read somewhere that you should buy a bow that is about 1/3 the cost of your violin does that make sense? I just bought an Eastman 80, which retails at around $600 CAD so I should get a bow in the $200 range?

,1623447748,nxr1iq," I played the violin for a decade in grade school growing up. I was at a pretty good level, in that I was often near concert master or concert master at the district level through middle school. In high school, the competition kind of ramped up, but I was still in the first few chairs usually. Made it to All-State barely. Got private lessons throughout that whole time.

A lot of parents and teachers I feel like overhyped my playing ability though. They thought I was going to be getting scholarships or that I was a prodigy or something, however I knew that I was nowhere near the level required to pursue it as a major in college and make that my career. And really, I didn't want to.

I haven't played the violin for 5 years now, and I'm in another career which I love and is very lucrative.

My issue is lately, I've kind of been thinking - I enjoy listening to classical violin and orchestral music even to this day. But there are a few things holding me back from ever picking up the instrument again.

1. I often times hated sitting in orchestra. Never want to go back to grinding out rehearsals ever again, which was so tedious.
2. I feel as if it's pointless if I'm not playing at a pro-level. The likes of Hahn and Oistrakh will always outclass me and pretty much the entire violin-playing population otherwise. So if a song is to be recorded to be shared and listened to by others, that caliber will be employed. So, then the question that follows is what's the point? If I like the song, why shouldn't I merely listen to them play it? What do I gain out of learning the song myself, since playing for others is pointless since it will never sound anywhere near as good as Hahn or Oistrakh. Just feels like a pointless waste of time to me.  


At least with guitar, there's a lot more improvisation opportunities, so you can actually feel like you're being creative and there's a purpose to it. But with violin, you are simply recreating what was composed. There isn't any actual creativity to it; it's almost entirely technical. And your recreation will always be inferior to Hahn or Oistrakh. So then why bother in the first place? I just don't understand.

To be fair, I feel like this about most hobbies that don't have a creative aspect to them. Like, I'm fine with personal programming, because that feels like it has a point - since no on else will exactly implement the application that I want to. Me not being the best programmer doesn't really take that away.

But with classical violin, you're just recreating, and in that case it feels pointless compared to just listening to Hahn or Oistrakh on YouTube.",violinist,"CMV: There's no point in playing the violin (particularly classical music) if you aren't angling to become a professional performer, especially considering how little scope there is for improvisation.",,1
,1623445837,nxqcao,"**TLDR (bolded-but here's the main one): do you feel that violin has trained you to be more dexterous with your non-dominant hand?**

I'm a lefty. I began violin at 3. I have only played with the bow in the right hand and never had a problem with it (that I can remember-I guess I was so young when I started, that if I did have handedness problems, I didn't remember, and by the time I started thinking more, the way I held the violin felt 'natural', and playing opposite would have felt off). I played throughout my childhood seriously, and considered conservatory, but ultimately realized that I wanted to be a doctor, and so I took that path, and violin is now my favorite pastime!

I had never really considered playing the violin 'left handed' until a few days ago when I was talking to a mentor of mine who was telling me about how ambidexterity is important in surgery, and how hard he found it to do simple tasks with his LH when he started practicing. This convo got me thinking more about being a lefty, and in the past few days, I have just started to notice that I do many more tasks with my RH than I would have expected (things like using my phone, picking up cups, brushing hair, knitting ...ext.) And while, for most of these tasks (except knitting-I only knit RH-ed), I do prefer my LH, I do oftentimes use my RH. I get the sense that if there is a spectrum in handedness (like how dominantly someone is L or R handed), I suspect that I fall closer to the middle of that spectrum. I would not call myself ambidextrous bc I write exclusively lefty, and do seem to have some more natural LH-edness. 

I wonder if my study of violin has trained me to be more ambidextrous, and that has developed into my daily life in which I do many tasks with my non-dominant hand. I'm not a great example for this, because I can't compare my dexterity before and after I started violin. But, I am wondering--for those of you who started later in life, **do you feel that violin has trained you to be more dexterous with your non-dominant hand** (regardless of if you are R or L handed)? Or, do you feel that your handedness has been an additional hurdle in learning the violin (as in this redditor's opinion [https://www.reddit.com/r/violinist/comments/g17ium/why\_the\_insistence\_on\_left\_handers\_learning/](https://www.reddit.com/r/violinist/comments/g17ium/why_the_insistence_on_left_handers_learning/) 

Originally, I was skeptical of this redditor's perspective, I guess because I am a LH violinist playing the traditional way, and I haven't had any problems, and it feels natural (probably the years of practice, so I guess the preference for me was able to be overcome). But then I was reading an article, that basically hypothesized that the people who succeed in violin are naturally (from a neurological basis) more ambidextrous (whether R or L handed) , and those with a strong LH preference have a hardest time with learning violin (with maybe strongly RH people also having a hard time, but not quite as much). I thought that was an interesting theory, in that nature vs nurture realm (ambidextrous traits) . I'm a 23f, grew up in the US, so I did not grow up in an area that forced people to change hands, but my understanding that when that is practiced, some students are able to overcome their natural proclivities (idk this is anecdotal from my best friend who grew up in pakistan, and immigrated to the US in elementary school and  was likely a lefty, but was trained to be a righty. She still writes and eats (what was trained to her) with her right hand, but does almost everything else with her left, and thinks that she would write and eat with her left if that wasn't conditioned out of her). But I also know, that historically, some lefties were never really able to develop dominance in their RH enough to write and eat comfortably with it-and maybe some of these people were more on the extreme side of LH-edness, and maybe people who are more profoundly left handed do have more significant challenges with learning violin. **For teachers, I am wondering...Have you ever had students who practiced and were just not able to 'overcome' the challenges associated with their handedness? (Those were committed to their practice habit, but just seemed to not be able to develop their non-dominant hand technique). Do you think that the students that are more ambidextrous students, that especially in their early education are the ones told they are 'natural with the violin'?**  I wonder this because if \~10% of the world is LH-ed, and maybe I hypothesize that \~20% of those LH-ed people are strongly left-handed (have less dexterity in the RH), then that means 2% of the population at large would be strongly left-handed, which is such a small number, that it seems reasonable that these students might just be written off as untalented even if they are trying their hardest? And if I make the same assumptions about the RH population, then the strongly RH people would be 18% of the world population. **I ofc recognize that there are a lot of factors that go into learning the violin, and that handedness is probably not a determining factor of much, but I am just interested in anecdotes about teaching, and if you have noticed or suspected any trends in this area. Also would be interested of any violinists who have thoughts about how they feel handedness or ambidexterity has impacted their playing!**",violinist,Handedness and ambidexterity as a violinist: has the violin caused you to have more dexterity in your non-dominant hand?,,1

Soloist,1623431674,nxl3tk,"Hello, I've noticed that this subreddit seems to lack a FAQ for beginners.  Scrolling through the sub I've noticed some common questions and mistakes. As I have some time on my hands, I wanted to make an ""all in one"" if you will.

1. Squeaky Playing, Whistling Sounds  
This is usually caused by 4 things. Not enough/too much rosin, bad bow technique, too much/too little pressure/bad strings.  
\-Not enough/too little rosin and how to tell: If your bow is shedding rosin dust like crazy in front of the bridge area (the wood thing holding all 4 strings up in the middle of the violin), then you'll see a coat of white dust on the violin after only a few minutes. This indicates that there is too much rosin on the bow. The best thing you can do is to just use the rosin up, passing it over a towel is fine too but thats just a waste of rosin.   
If you have too little rosin, your bow hairs will slide around on the strings and cause whistling sounds. When you notice this, pass your bow over your cake of rosin 2-6 times depending on how sticky your rosin is. Generally, the more expensive the rosin, the fewer passes you need.  

2. Bridge Slanted  
How to tell: Look at the bridge from the side of the violin, if the feet are raised on one side more so than the other, then your bridge is slanted (usually to the left). Look at your bridge at an angle perpendicular to it, if it looks slanted to one side, then it probably is. The black part of the violin (fingerboard) should be parallel to the bridge.  
What to do: As a beginner, I don't recommend fixing this issue yourself. You could easily break the feet of the bridge if you don't know exactly what you're doing. Take it to your local violin store and ask for it to be adjusted, this will usually be free of cost.  

3. How Tight To Tension The Bow Hairs.  
There should be a slight curve in the wood, not too dramatic but shouldn't be straight as a ruler either.  

4. How To Tune The Violin  
Don't do this step yourself if you're an absolute beginner, bring it to the shop and they'll teach you how to tune it without breaking your instrument. You can try tuning yourself only after they teach you how to tune.   

5. Sweaty Hands  
Play with a fan on or in a cooler environment. Try to relax more.   

6. Bad Intonation (Wrong Notes)  
Play with a tuner and check or buy stickers for your fretboard (ONLY IF YOU HAVE A CHEAP VIOLIN YOU DON'T MIND PUTTING STICKERS ON, DO NOT DO THIS ON AN EXPENSIVE VIOLIN) [https://www.amazon.com/FineFun-Violin-Finger-Fingerboard-Sticker/dp/B01JJ51CRQ](https://www.amazon.com/FineFun-Violin-Finger-Fingerboard-Sticker/dp/B01JJ51CRQ)  

7. Shifting Between Positions  
Undershifting: Relax your hand more, practice the motion slower.  
Overshifting: Hand too relaxed, practice the motion slower.  

8. What Bow Hold To Use  
Personal preference, the most popular bow holds are the ""Russian Bow Hold"" and ""Franco-Belgian Bow Hold"". Video instructions available on Youtube. Choose the hold most comfortable for you.  

9. Violin Maintenance  
Strings: Buy violin string cleaner off amazon and apply to microfibre cloth, hold cloth between thumb and pointer finger with the solution on the string side. With an up and down motion, wipe the strings clean. There will be squeaking, that is normal. Just don't grip the strings too hard or you'll destroy the bridge.  
Other Parts: Use a microfibre cloth (NOT the same one you used for strings), and just wipe the violin down gently. Do NOT add any liquid or chemical, a simple wipe is more than enough. Remember to wipe the wood under where your bow rests. Get every bit of that white rosin dust off. Clean within 4 hours ish or the rosin will start sticking to the wood.  
Keep violin away from direct sunlight, away from all liquids and chemicals, away from food, heat, extreme cold. (30C+ and 5C or under, temperature changes could crack the violin).  

10. Vibrato  
 Hold your palm out facing the sky, pick a finger (pref ring finger) point the ring finger upwards with the top two finger joints. Without moving any of your fingers move your palm towards you using your wrist, then move it back down to starting position and repeat. It's hard to describe the motion without showing it to you. There is good video instruction on Youtube if you don't have a teacher. (NOTE: Learning vibrato before having good intonation is a bad idea, don't do it)  

11. Bow Arm Technique  
Make sure your bow is parallel to the bridge at all times. Bow should be right in the middle of the finger board and bridge.  
Bow hairs should be flat on the string, there are more advanced techniques where you slant the hairs at an angle but as the name suggests, they are advanced, do not attempt them yet. Your elbow should be the one guiding the bow, not your deltoids. For a clearer explanation on this, watch a bow arm technique video on Youtube, there's only a limited amount of information I can convey through text.  

12. How Long To Practice  
3 Hours a day at most, regular breaks every 30 mins or so. Overworking is not at all beneficial musically and technically unless your name is Paganini or Liszt.  

13. How To Practice  
Personal preference, everyone has their own routine. This is mine if you want a good reference:  
15 Mins Scales, major minor harmonic melodic chromatic double stops, arpeggios, consonant intervals.  
15 Mins of Bach  
1 Hour of the piece I'm currently working on  

14. What pieces do I play?  
Buy any beginners violin book from your music store and work on that. Do not attempt anything clearly out of your skill level, you have a chance of injuring yourself in the process without knowing proper technique.  

15. Musical Practice or Mechanical Practice  
Up to you. Musical practice allows you to play more expressively but you learn technique slower while mechanical practice allows you to learn techniques quicker but sacrificing musicality. (I prefer the former)  

16. What Violin Do I Buy?  
Go to your local violin store (DO NOT ORDER ONLINE, USUALLY BAD IDEA) and ignoring looks, try out violins in your budget. Pick the one whose sound you like the most.  

17. Is This Violin From My Grandmas Basement Authentic?  
If it says Stradivarius inside then its likely a German copy. Same for Guaneri. Otherwise, take it to a good violin luthier and have them appraise it for you, nobody on this sub is likely to know, closer inspection by hand is required for appraisals and such.  

18. Is This Piece Within My Skill Level?  
Try it, if you sound like a chicken being tortured then it is too difficult for you, try something easier.

Adult Beginner,1623420898,nxgzes,"Based on my online research, I think I already know the answer to these questions is yes. I wanted to get a second opinion from the wealth of experience on this sub. 

I’ve left my violin in the case for 3 years, almost completely untouched. I stored it in a room with constant temperature and very steady humidity so the instrument seems to be in fine condition as far as I can tell. Pegs are still working well, stays in tune, etc. 


I don’t dislike the way my strings sound, but they must have gone off in that time frame, right? I left them at tension that whole time. Should I replace them now?

Similar question about my bow hair. I’ve never rehaired my bows to begin with, three years on top of that in the case (not under tension of course!) should I get a rehair?

The hair isn’t too tight or loose, but would it simply be worn out from age and previous use?

All the seams look fine, the bridge is straight. The varnish has developed some hairline cracks when viewed from the right angle in the light, but I understand that can be normal. I’m not noticing any issues with the violin, but I probably won’t be going into a shop or having an in person lesson for a while here. If anyone has other suggestions for things to check to make sure it’s in good shape I would welcome the input.

In case you don't know me or my posts: Hi, I'm Shayla,I'm 25yo and started to learn the violin 7,5 months ago. I come from prior woood wind exp, but I haven't had a shimmer of strings. I play scales, etudes and pieces around 1 to 2 hours every day. It's my way of unwinding after a long day at work.

&amp;#x200B;

I found this community and hesistantly started uploading my performances. Over the time, I got a solid of 5 to 10 upvotes and likes per video, mostly from the same people, that I really come to like. My posts were never really that popular, but I enjoyed conversing with those people in the comments.

&amp;#x200B;

So, now to my reason of leaving. Recently I got a stretch piece by my teacher (Bach Solo, Partita E-Major, Minuett 1 and 2, Gigue and Bourree. I know, way out of reach, but so much fun to pay!) after I expressed an interest in learning a simplified version of a Bach piece. My teacher knows that I like learning on pieces better than on etudes, so he prmoised me we can start learning double stops on those 2 minuets. Now, don't get me wrong, I still play etudes and they are fun in their own way, but actual music gives me sth that I just don't get from an etude.

Excited as I was, I posted it here, expecting the same 5 people to comment under it that always do and nothing more. I did NOT expect it to blow up this big. I was really astounded by the amount of negative and downright belittleing comments I got under that post. Will this be slow-going? Yes. Is it still slowgoing, after I nearly had one week on it? Yes. Do I regret playing this piece? No. It's beautiful.

What really put the nail in the coffin for me though is this article and the comments under it:

 [The Difference Between Learning to Play the Violin and Dabbling with Advanced Repertoire (violinist.com)](https://www.violinist.com/blog/laurie/20216/28797/) 

Just to put this here, once and for all: I do not ""dabble"". My teacher has a structure and a reason in his lessons and the way he teaches me. I have a structured practice plan, every time I open my vioolin case. I do NOT just pull it out, open imslp and play whatever. Only because that teaching plan does not fit with your own style of teaching or you learned differently, doesn't make any other teaching methods invalid. I play etudes and scales just like any other violin student as well.

I get it, at the end of the day it's the internet and everyone can have their own opinion on what people publish. I, myself, have no further interest in making myself that vulnerable and open to attacks on my person any longer, so I will unsub from this reddit.

Improving one's skills, on the other hand, seems much harder. I feel improvement is an uphill battle and one really needs to put in a few hours per day in practice over a fairly long period of time for results to show. For most great players, they probably built up their skills as teenagers or in their early 20s by practicing long hours.

I recently received an old violin from my grandmother. It was her father's instrument, which he got in about 1906 in upper peninsula Michigan. We know nothing about it, except that story and that the instrument is in *terrible* condition. I brought it to a shop and they said it would take 5-10 thousand to get it back to playing condition, so that is not going to happen.

I spotted a label on the inside of the piece, which reads

The person at the violin shop said that it was probably a fake, but only gave it a cursory glance. Are there any tips for identifying if it is legitimate or not?

Is it possible (for an advanced player) to transition from a normal note to the harmonic of that note by slowly decreasing finger pressure on the string?  


For example: On the violin, play a G on the D string, then reduce finger pressure to produce the 4th harmonic of the D string, which would sound a D two octaves above, all while playing the same bow-stroke (continuous note).

Adult Beginner,1623224671,nvq4xt,"Bow hold is a problem I’ve had for what seems like forever. To explain, I have a very comfortable bow hold that looks proper, feels comfortable, is flexible, I can even do Colle to some extent (it’s way closer to the Franco-Belgian hold I think) - so it’s basically what we aim for, right? But that is only true when I’m simply holding the bow, or playing on the lower 3/4’s of the bow. Once I reach the upper quarter my bow hold has to change somehow otherwise I can’t reach the tip with a straight bow.

I’ve tried different ways (when I reached the upper quarter): dislodging my shoulder (obviously a very bad idea, so stopped immediately), putting the weight on my ring finger (kept my bow hold like an FB but obviously I couldn’t give weight to the bow to keep the sound sustained, and my index became oddly curved above the bow), simply not going straight after that point (doesn’t sound very good and from what I’ve read isn’t suggested for beginners that need to learn how a straight bow looks before doing such things), holding the bow a bit higher (I did get a bir higher and it worked a little bit but any higher and I feel like I’m losing the control). These were basically failed attempts. 

One thing that works a bit is pronating my arm more therefore giving the necessary weight, and I can reach a little bit more, though still a few inches left at the tip. The problem with this one is that it puts tension on my forearm and wrist which might be a recipe for injuries. I’m thinking maybe the muscles need to adapt as they never had to do such movements but I’m not sure if this is the way to go. 
The other thing that works a little is really changing my bow hold from what is more an FB to something way closer to Russian at the tip (maybe with differing degrees, so sometimes I went almost full Russian mode, whereas other times I tried to keep in between as much as possible). Basically, the area where my index finger contacts the bow changes and I get more on top of the bow. Now, this is what my teacher suggested, she actually said “Can you not fix it later?”. Yes I can, but it’s really not efficient. It’s not efficient during a slow bow, I can’t imagine how inefficient it would be on fast and long bows. 

This was a long post… But long story short, I want to ask your opinion on this matter. (By the way I don’t think I’m too short, more like average so I don’t think I have short arms, but I don’t know.) How do you guys reach the tip? Is it normal to change bow holds at the tip or is it a matter of muscles developing?",violinist,Bow hold,Technique,1

This, at least, is the story we were told: in about 1965 my dad, at age 15, was working for a cousin one summer tearing down an old house. It was on Church St. in Tupelo, Mississippi. It was a big old wooden house, probably from the 1890's to 1910's. Inside one of the walls, he found a case with a violin inside. The cousin told him he could keep it (or so he told us), and he kept it in his closet for about 50 years. We started looking at getting some more information on it last year and then my dad passed away in February. A few days ago I did get it back from a local shop with an appraisal on its worth for tax purposes.

We wish we knew more about its history. There is a label inside the violin that reads:  
""RENE BAILLY, 719 Julien Ave. Dubuque, Iowa, Son of Paul Bailly, Paris. Awarded 10 Gold and Silver Medals Paris Exposition.""

How it went from Dubuque to Tupelo, MS, we will probably never know. We don't know the names of the families in that house, or at this point even the address, much less why they put it inside the wall of the house and forgot about it. My dad was a bit of a mess and I've harbored some suspicion about the story, but my mom feels certain the origin he told was true - and they were together since high school. About the label: would the medals have been awarded to the creator (Rene) for his work on other instruments or to a person playing this particular instrument? Was the exposition something that occurred frequently, and when might it have been?

Finally, we have no idea what to do with it. We aren't a musical family, and it looks like it needs some work to get in playable condition (maybe as much as it's total valuation currently). I guess I'd look at having it auctioned off, but getting a stand and keeping it on display in the house has some appeal (though without a bridge and strings it doesn't look as cool).

What would you do with it? Any other thoughts or suggestions on it?

What is your point of view about it? If you are using that bow hold, is there specific things that I should look for with my right hand and is there exercices specifically designed to smooth it a little? I still feel a bit stiff.

Amateur,1623048285,nu60fy,"The answer is obviously yes. That is the good news. Regardless of where you are, and when you started, you can definitely reach the speed and left hand proficiency of any violinist you see (unless you have some medical issue with your hand). It is only a question of persistence and time.

There are three components in left hand technique: dexterity and ""sense of beat"" of fingers, precision of finger placement on the fingerboard at different positions, and stretch. Fundamentally, those are not that much different from, say, demands on a karate student or a juggler apprentice or a dancer. Enough running, stretches and (mindful) repetitions are bound to bring you were you want to be. Your talents, or in-born coordination and flexibility, would help you move faster. But ultimately, having patience and persistence, you will get there. Maybe only super-flex-stretch-fast pieces like Ernst and some Paganini would be not within the realm of practical reachability for an adult beginner, for example. But this is like a small fraction of a percent of all a violinist could play!

This reachability is a big good news which I truly appreciated only recently and decided to share with all those who is a beginner, or simply gets desperate at times (easy thing to happen practicing violin).

So I did some research and want to know what kind of rabbit (or gopher) hole I have wandered into.

How much of a difference does different breeds of horse hair make?

Do luthiers often carry several types of horse hair or will this be a deal that I should get two bows and ship one at a time off back to the fiddlershop for rehearing?  I'm guessing that I should have it redhaired with the original type that came with the bow.

Amateur,1622785238,nrxofa,"So I recently got a new bridge cut and fit for my violin and some bowing things that were borderline impossible like the Mendelssohn four-string ricochet suddenly became much easier (relatively speaking).  So I've been working a lot on the Mendelssohn ricochet passage and getting it cleaner and more consistent and I've been making slow but steady progress.  So naturally, I got cocky and started looking at the Ricci arrangement of Recuerdos.  I'm pretty baffled.

Can anyone here actually play this competently and consistently?  If so, please post a jam video and answer my questions.  =)

With the Mendelssohn, I've found that some of the left hand chords allow the bow to bounce more than others.  I'm assuming this is because you're stretching the string, which pulls it more taut, which allows more of a bounce.  For instance, when I try to do four-string ricochet with all open strings, it's much, much harder to get it clean with good bounces than with the starting chord of the passage (B,G,B,E from low to high).  Ricochet is also very sensitive to contact point, which is frustrating me further.

I've discovered the same is true for the Recuerdos, but it's even worse.  Getting a smooth cycling single-string ricochet feels much easier for me on the D string than on A.  E is the hardest.  I have to use some right hand index finger pressure to get any real ricochet going on the E string, but then it's hard to get it to cycle repeatedly.

I've looked for youtubes of great players explaining ricochet relevant to Recuerdos.  There are a few like from Kerson Leong and Augustin Hadelich, but they give general tips of modest usefulness and not how to build it up through practice.

I'm definitely willing to sink many hours into this, but I don't even know where to start.  If anyone has learned this bow technique, what did your practice progression look like?  What exercises did you cook up to take you from zero to Recuerdos-hero?

,1622551552,npt5su,"This will be a bit of a weird question. In a few words my question is, does anyone know whether different makers in different countries that use different currencies put a price on their violins taking the currency rates into account?

To elaborate… You see, I live in a country that has a different currency than dollars or euros, and my currency has significantly lower value than those currencies. When I look online to see what good violins cost, it’s usually tens of thousands of dollars (which would cost me almost ten times more than that in my currency). For example, for simplicity’s sake, let’s say there is a good violin for 20.000 dollars (I hope that would be considered an actually good/not bad at all type of violin…). If a local violin maker built a violin that would be considered on a similar level, would they give it the same price (20.000 dollars) or would they give a price considering their currency (20.000 whatever currency, or more or less whatever it would be in proportion to the average income). 

Or maybe a simpler way to ask this question would be, if you live in an area that uses a currency other than dollars/euros, are violins sold in their dollars/euros equivalent, or for more or less the same number but in your currency?

Of course it would be easier if I could just go to a violin maker in my city, but it’s not a good time right now, and I don’t know any good or reputable violin makers as I am quite new to the violin (but as far as I’ve seen, I think there aren’t that many makers here) and I’m just starting to save money for a good one for when the time comes.",violinist,A question about violin prices and currencies…,,1

I played some in high school and then got lessons again in college and really wanted to do something more serious with it, but alas, life got in the way again.

Now in my 30s I overall hadn't played much, I'd go through stints of playing more, but this winter I started playing a lot. At first every few days, then when I decided to do a 100 day project with a variety of creative arts (drawing, writing, violin, etc.) I actually ended up focusing on the violin and playing it most days. I played more Jan-March than I had in years! 

I've played more in the past 5 months than the last 5 years! It'sincredible. I did invest in every other week lessons (found an incredible teacher but he's getting busier now that stuff is opening again). I do recommend lessons to those who can swing it, but of course there is plenty available online now compared to when I was a wee lass. The combination of using online resources and videos, along with this sub, and the lessons, has added up to some awesome progress. I've been working on pieces with shifting into third/fifth/etc. (which I had zero confidence in prior to a few months ago), both parts of the Bach concerto for two violins (I'd only ever played the 2nd), and the unfortunately neglected skill of vibrato due to breaks in instruction. I do intend to post a playing video here soon if I work up the courage (not the Bach haha)!

**Now for my silly good news / bad news:** *The Good -* I've been practicing a lot and to those of you who avoid it (like I did when I was younger in between lessons and/or when I didn't have lessons prompting me to perform a bit), I swear it really does work! I was always trying to coast by on the bit of natural talent I had, but it is soo much about that practice, however you do it. (Fun to see progress in two week chunks looking back at what I learned.)

I'm a composer amd I am doing a set of recordings with a seemingly good violinist and pianist. We're running into a snag with one passage. I turn to you advanced virtuosi for help:

It involves harmonics and long slow high notes.

In this mostly quite playable piece, there are these three measures where I've asked the player to play a long cresc/decresc A5 harmonic then same dynamics for a 5th above that (E6)harmonic,  then same for a long G6 harmonic. He's cracking his tone every time on the G6 harmonic and I'm thinking of giving up on the color (even though it's exactly the kind of ringing-metallic kind of tone needed there) and asking him to play the G6 normally. 

I think he's being heroic saying he's goimg to try hard to do it. But I have come to a point where I just want to find am easy out for the both of us. But with a language barrier I have to deliver my point very succinctly. 

I wonder:
1) is G6 artificial harmonic a terrible ask?
2) is it more easily successful if it's sul A and he does G (a 7th above) and then the fingered harmonic? 
3) is the sans vibrato fundamental note G6 harder to do?

,1622242517,nn9weo,"I'm an adult beginner currently in university and I started about 6 months ago. I'm taking bi-weekly classes so that I can balance practice and study, and that works great for me. I have a little bit of prior experience in music and my teacher keeps commenting that I'm progressing very quickly, so I wouldn't say that the extra time between lesson is hindering me.

The only thing is that whenever I have midterms or finals coming up, I start off thinking I'll be able to handle having a lesson also around that time, but then a couple of days before I realize that it's really not ideal (can't practice efficiently when I have to do exam prep and having a lesson close to an test date makes it so I can't really focus on the lesson well either).

Is it okay to keep notifying my teacher a couple days before the lesson that I would like to delay it to the week after or is it rude to my teacher? This really only happens twice per semester, although this summer is split into two mini-semesters, so it could happen four times this summer. 

Maybe I could try to just never schedule a class around midterm / finals period, but then the schedule won't be as regular as straight biweekly lessons. I guess if I wind up delaying the lessons it winds up being the same anyway. 

The result is just a little awkward. For example I would like to delay my next lesson to a week later, but then two weeks after that lands right before the start of my first exam period. I don't know the dates of my exams, so it could be a full week before (which would be fine) or much closer (not okay). So to be safe, I would have to reschedule it to almost a month after next lesson, potentially rescheduling it earlier if I finish early in the exam period, and I'm not sure how that looks to my teacher. It's likely the same thing would happen for my second summer term also.

I don't like weekly lessons because I feel like it's not enough time for me to practice well and I like going into my lessons feeling prepared. I think it makes better use of the lesson time for both my teacher and I. It also helps me feel more motivated because I don't feel forced to practice when I don't want to. Every time I pick up the instrument it brings me joy and not frustration. I want to keep enjoying that kind of freedom and I would never want the ""stress"" of lessons to get in the way of the love I have for music. I dabble in a couple of instruments and I enjoy rotating between them when I have more time between my lessons as well.

Could anyone guide me on the proper ethics of class scheduling? Is it okay to have sometimes biweekly sometimes monthly lessons to avoid rescheduling? When I requested moving from weekly to biweekly lessons my teacher said that she normally didn't support students having biweekly lessons but that she would accept it in my case. I guess I'm just nervous about what she'll think if I end up sometimes scheduling monthly lessons because of exam timing, even if it's what's best for me for all the reasons I stated above. 

Rationally I know that I pay her and so, the weird scheduling probably isn't a big deal, but I still feel like I'm imposing an inconvenience and implying things about my commitment to the instrument (implications which couldn't be more wrong), and that makes me uncomfortable. Should I disregard that and just do what's best for me?

I'm sure a lot of it has to do with how much I would like to spend, but price doesn't always mean quality. I would like to spend anywhere from $200 to $500 but would rather not get too close to the top end unless highly suggested. Also, I didn't know if my best option would be to find a used one, but that always scares me a little as I don't know what things to look for.

Her current Stentor is the pink one, as she loves color, but I am finding most good ones are wood colored.

I can buy a dirt cheap violin and look for tutorials (first), I got something called ""Suzuki method"" and after finding out if my hand can be more flexible and endure more pain (there's chronic pain that increases after exercise) I can look for a teacher.

My left hand didn't heal properly after an accident and 3 surgeries. Thumb, index and middle fingers are a bit stiff and the wrist is crooked slightly to the right. Knowing absolutely nothing about playing violin can be an advantage, maybe I can hold the bow with the left and the violin with the right.

,1622006547,nl95el,"Hi everyone, I’ll try to make this make sense. I am 15F and I have been taking lessons with my violin teacher 23M for about 5 months now, and i think it’s time to say goodbye. The reason why i want to leave  is because I don’t think he can really help me with what Im doing as well as other teachers could. Here are the reasons why I’m considering leaving, and tell me if I’m being too harsh.

1. He is 23, did not go to college for music, and mostly teaches young beginners. I’m not saying I’m advanced or anything, but I have been working on the Accolay Violin Concerto for quite a long time and it’s still not at how I want it to sound

2. Along with number 1, it’s hard to know what he wants me to do technically. I don’t know if this is harsh, and if it is then i’m sorry, but I think that because he didn’t get enough music education, I don’t think he should be teaching me. He barely demonstrates things to me on his own violin, and when he does, it sounds kind of not good at all

2.  Another reason why I’m considering leaving him is because he does not listen to what I need. In my school orchestra class, we have studio class once every week and we basically get critiqued on our playing. One time, for example, I was told by my fellow classmates and teacher to try different fingerings, which I thought was a good idea. I went back to my private teacher and he literally said “What do orchestra teachers know anyway? You sound fine. Let’s move on!” NO!! I don’t sound fine and I feel like you aren’t listening to me. This has happened multiple times.

Ok that’s it, but the reason i don’t want to leave is because he is a very nice person and we have good conversations and he is generally agreeable (except for what i mentioned in #3)

If i should leave him, how do i do it? I cannot do it in person. One because that’s awkward, and two because we pay for violin lessons monthly, so tell him at next weeks lesson I’ll still have to go for the rest of the month, or lose that money. So i’m doing it over text.

Started taking lessons in person 4 weeks ago with a retired elementary school teacher. 

I didn’t read music at the beginning, and knew nothing about this instrument. Had to go around the house saying GDAE...Good Dogs Always Eat. Tried to put the shoulder rest on the wrong end. Opened my case upside down. So tired for my brain to read the notes and hard for my hands to go into those positions. 

Practicing after my lesson today something clicked and my bowing actually sounds melodious — not like sharp, broken parts with long pauses in between. I’m definitely playing less badly than I was at the end of April. 

After it clicked, I walked around our main level playing up and down the D scale over and over. Told my husband “this sounds like music!”

I'm usually very conscious of how I hold the bow because I'm quite petite (4'10 or just to be safe and I don't anger u/Pennwisedom and get accused of shrinking again lol so 4'95). My teacher did suggest I might need a shorter bow but i was like NAH I AM GOING FULL MONTY. IF I'M GONNA PLAY, I WILL GO ALL OUT. I AIN'T GOING SMALLER IF I DON'T HAVE TO.

And of course after every lesson I doubt myself and think ""Maybe she's right. Maybe I should get a smaller violin.""

But I guess I've just learnt to adapt how to hold and position myself when I use the upper part of the bow. It definitely is still a struggle sometimes, especially since my arm is fully extended and straight that my fingers do come up a bit high on the frog. It definitely was hard in the beginning because bending your wrist and having your arm straight and you need to apply pressure because you're at the tip.

Teacher,1621656149,nia9tj,"I've always been interested in teaching students with special circumstances or accommodations, and just over a month after I've started teaching, I've been sent one!

She's older, I don't remember how old exactly, at least late 50s. And she has arthritis. At my school we meet our students in the parking lot due to covid, so I watched her get out of her car and walk over to me and she was noticeably slow and stiff with her movements. She seems to have hunched posture normally as well,  and straightening up to play and adhering the violin to the shoulder seems to be close to the limit of her movement, but I'm not totally sure, since I'm still getting used to teaching students that have never played before and getting them set up with proper posture.

I have of course been experimenting with her, setup wise, to get a good fit. But I've been having issues. She seems to have short shoulders, and a short but wide neck, which means that with my Kun Solo on the violin in a normal spot, the crook of the shoulder rest is actually out past the end of her shoulder. I've never seen this happen before so I'm not quite sure the route to go moving forward.

Making matters worse, the closest thing we have to a shop nearby is a Music and Arts, which has all of two different kinds of shoulder rests, so I can't think of a way to get her a wide selection to try.

We have considered The Way of The Sponge, but I'm not experienced with using sponges because I was an adult beginner, so I've always used a regular shoulder rest. And my other beginning students seem to still have to use a bit of left hand pressure to hold the instrument with sponges, which I would like to avoid if at all possible, considering she already is going to be much stiffer than normal.

We may have no choice, though, because like I said earlier, a usual shoulder rest actually sits out past the end of her shoulder, so I'm not sure even the more innovative ones like a Performa or a Bon Musica will work...

Hi, I'm trying to play the violin part of Antonin Dvorak - Serenade for strings in E Major (Tempo di valse). And i'm having trouble with the fingerings. Right now i'm going 1 3 4 3 2 | 1 1 1    
And yea, i'm not going to cover more fingerings since that triple 'one' finger is a problem. Which fingering should i use?

Unfortunately i don't have a teacher i can ask these question too.  
Grateful for any tips, or techniques i should look in to more.",violinist,Dvorak - Serenade for strings,,1
,1621572362,nhka1n,Hi everyone. I was practicing the Bruch VC 1st mvnt and i lost a bunch of bow hairs from playing the chords part (34-36). Not sure if that is normal or not. Would love to hear your experience if youve played this concerto!,violinist,Losing lots of bow hairs,Original,1
,1621564105,nhhx8u,"[https://imgur.com/a/N6pBY79](https://imgur.com/a/N6pBY79)

Is my understanding correct that these intervals in the first bar are as follows:

  
1. Minor third (g natural +  b flat)

2. Minor third (g natural +  b flat)

3. Minor third (f natural + a flat)

4. Major third (e flat + g natural)

5. Major third (g natural + b natural)  


If that is correct, and armed with that knowledge, can you share how to understand, finger, and practice thirds both in particular to this section and in general?  


Currently I do the following fingering:  
1. 4th and 2nd finger 

2. 4th and 2nd finger 

3. 3rd and 1st finger 

4. Shift down and use 3rd and 1st finger

5. Shift up and use 4th and 2nd finger (or 4th finger and 3rd finger)  


I also try to do the following:

1. Play the notes individually

2. Play the notes together but slowly

3. Use reference notes with the open strings (e.g. if I want an A flat on the E string, I finger the A natural while tuning it to the open A string, then put my finger behind that A natural to get the A flat)  


My issues:

1. If the above is correct, it's merely out of rote, not because I really understand thirds in the musical and technical sense. I fear that I'm missing out on something.  
2. I have a hard time determining if they are in tune or not (it's not like fifths or octaves where I can audibly the fluttering when I'm out of tune) without doing #3 above

3. If I shift down from Minor third to Major third using the same fingers, I can't reliably shift the fingers independently to their final location (since the distance the first finger moves is different from the distance the other finger moves).  


Is this just a matter of:  
1. Practicing over and over 

2. Breaking down the movements (e.g. shift first to the proper position while maintaining finger distance, then only after shifting one moves the finger/s)

2. Some trick/skill/theory (e.g. aural skills) I have yet to learn

3. Something else?  


Appreciate any help, I tried googling ""violin third intervals"" but I either keep getting results about general music theory, third position, or something too abstract for me.

Expert,1621486527,ngr70r,"I am currently working with Baerenreiter on reviewing/proofing/editing their drafts for the upcoming release of Beethoven Opus 132 later this year (keep an eye out for it!). In case people are curious and also want to nerd out, I thought I would share some of the interesting considerations that get discussed sometimes ""behind the scenes."" I hope this encourages and inspires some of you to dig deeply into your own music, too.

First, I should note that I have studied the Henle Urtext version edited by Emil Platen, the Kalmus parts with Joachim's fingerings and bowings, and the holograph manuscript from Beethoven himself (a digital copy of which is [here](https://imslp.simssa.ca/files/imglnks/usimg/8/8c/IMSLP396234-PMLP05046--Mus.ms.autogr._Beethoven,_L._v.,_Mendelssohn-Stiftung_11-_Quartetto_Op.132_03.pdf)).

Focusing on the [famous and absolutely gorgeous third movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8TeeYZVe6Q), a little taste of our conversations include:

* The Italian description in the manuscript and whether it should be included given it looks like it may have been written in a hand other than Beethoven's
* The Italian description and whether it is appropriate to capitalize the ""D"" in Divinita which might be more grammatically correct - but is not faithful to the manuscript (which did not capitalize the D)
* The use of the abbreviation ""tenu."" to be faithful to Beethoven's writing when ""ten."" is used more commonly today
* The absence of sforzandos in the 1st violin part on the third 1/8 note when the Andante returns. Was this Beethoven being forgetful? Was it intentional? If so, why?
* The appropriateness of adding in a piano in measure 47 when one version of the manuscript doesn't include this, but it is a popular performance practice.
* What to do about extraneous accidentals that Beethoven included in his manuscript. Ignore them? Include them? Include them but with editorial notes?
* The appropriateness of converting notes Beethoven wrote oddly in 8va form to their normal state.
* The addition of editorial slurs in measure 138 of the 1st violin part and the judgment call of whether this was simply just forgetfulness on Beethoven's part.
* How to play the second to last measure. Why didn't Beethoven just write it out as half notes like earlier in the Molto adagio - and because he broke out the 1/8ths, should we play them differently as a result? How does it all change given the ambiguity of his slurs?

For kids who can't reliably find the right grip on their own (especially now that hands-on physical correction is made impossible by COVID distancing), I really want to be able to use a ""[bow hold buddy](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Set-StringsTM-Teaching-Accessory/dp/B002QAWNDE)"" equivalent.

I’ve been playing for around 6 years (I’m 14 years old) and obviously as I’ve grown I’ve had to  change my shoulder rest/chinrest setup. Just before the pandemic fully hit last year I got a new violin (went from 3/4 to 4/4) and ever since then it’s just been a constant struggle with trying to find a setup that is comfortable and doesn’t leave me sore after like thirty minutes of practice. Obviously lockdown doesn’t really help in terms of going out and trying to find a good match for me but about a month ago I got a new shoulder and chin rest and I think the CR has been a definite upgrade but do find myself constantly readjusting the SR. I have a relatively short neck and I feel like the violin is constantly slipping, never staying upright. This makes shifting (esp. back down the neck) very tense and I am also struggling to develop my vibrato because of this. I often practice in front of a mirror and it has made me fully aware of my posture which can be slouched and crooked, my neck sort of protrudes forward to compensate for the violin slipping which causes me to look slightly downward (this might also be a product of my sheet music not being at eye level because I don’t have a proper music stand at home), and I can REALLY feel the consequence of that neck position because it always aches afterwards. I also don’t know if this makes any sense but I get discomfort on the left side of my jaw and teeth because I tend to clamp down on the violin using my jaw to account for how not-secure it feels.

I really missed taking lessons in the last two years, and am looking into teachers around my university town. Some teachers I found through the school (actual professors in the music department) are really good teachers but charge \~$100 per hour. My school is in California, so I guess everything's pricier out here, but still that is a lot for a college student. But on the other hand, this might be my only chance to study with a teacher at such a high level. 

I was wondering, from your experience, if you found studying with high level teachers like this worth the extra bucks? Do they really help you grow musically? Or would finding a music major at the school who obviously charges less suffice?

Because I practiced so hard this morning, after my 2nd piece (Mozart 3) my left hand started cramping up and I messed up the last line of my 4th piece (Bartok's Romanian Dances), I was out of time with my accompanist for that entire last line as well. 

I kind of pulled things back to a controlled pace in the beginning of my last piece (Partita No.2 Sarabande) but absolutely choked the 2nd page of Gigue due to my hand cramping up against the semiquavers.

So, for the sake of context, let me tell you a little bit about my playing.  I've been playing the violin for six years and I've been steadily progressing on it.  In the past couple of years, I've joined a few orchestras (most community orchestras), and every semester, I have to audition for one, which is a youth symphony orchestra (that part is important but I'll get on that later).

I feel for somebody whose been playing for six years, I don't sound as good as I should.  On top of that, I also look at prodigies and I feel even more like a failure.  There are times when I consider quitting the violin just because if people like them exist, what's the point of me trying to make it?  What's the point of me, some failure of a violinist, even trying?  I feel so hopeless.

I also feel extremely helpless too because my youth symphony orchestra has auditions up and I have to get one sent in before May 23 (these are virtual auditions).  I'm preparing Solo Bach (Gavotte en Rondeau, Partita #3 in E Major) and I feel like that sounds awful.  The final section before the theme comes up again is so difficult and it sounds clumsy whenever I play it.  I'm working hard on polishing it but it never sounds good enough.

I had all four wisdom teeth surgically removed about 4 weeks ago. I took about a week and a half off from playing violin.

Well half a decade later my life has settled down and I want to get back into learning an instrument. Just something to add to my repertoire. So I decided I want to pick upon a different instrument, maybe one I could use to enhance my performance when playing bards at the D&amp;D table. So I picked up a cheap learning violin. Now I just need some learning resources and was hoping the fine folks of this sub could help me by providing some virtual ones I can simply pick up and work through in my own time.

,1620836543,naspp8,"I used to play Violin back in middleschool and on the very rare (like once every 2 year) occasion. 

I ordered a violin through amazon, they said they lost it in the mail and to just keep it if it comes in. So I thought cool then got a second love of mine (Guitar) where I quit after learning like 3 chords and 2 songs because the F chord (it's named that for a reason BTW).

Well, I've been plucking away at the guitar, and have been trying to fiddle (I bought cheap starter instruments because I didn't know if I'd lose interest right away or not, and they'd be fun).

I think I fell in love with fiddling. I was playing the Violin 1 version of Pirates of the Caribean (My favorite song to play) but thought about fiddling as parts of it require fast playing on the E string.... OH MY GOD I have been practicing ""Devil's Dream"" and I have so much fun and I pick away at the guitar (I am much better at violin having played a few years VS guitar where I make a lot of mistakes)

It just seems you're in another realm when you're fiddling as it requires a lot of concentration

**TLDR: My goal is to be able to play a few songs with the guitar (I'd love to be able to take it camping and do this) but I think it's way cooler to fiddle and would LOVE to expand upon this.

I went from playing for around 25-30 hours a week to maybe 10 at most. A lot of that 10 was made up from practicing, so because I was practicing more, my vibrato was still ok throughout the summer. I never stopped taking lessons but the piece I played over the summer (Bach Partita in E Major Prelude) required very little vibrato, and that combined with the reduce playing time really affected it. When school started and I had less time to practice it got even worse. I started pushing my wrist out instead of keeping it straight and I’ve mostly fixed it on my 2nd and 3rd finger, and my 4th is getting there, but my 1st finger is still very tense.

I've been using my bow for years and years since I was having lessons at school and have never had it rehaired - it hasn't lost much hair but it is a bit grotty so I was considering having it rehaired. However, I'm pretty sure it's [this](https://www.gear4music.com/Woodwind-Brass-Strings/Westbury-Bulletwood-Violin-Bow-4-4-Size/1MB8?origin=product-ads&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw-e2EBhAhEiwAJI5jgwpXxojcGFraYNigjwE2GVGYJ3RETnehPjnW8IPYN7sY2RYUdFyx6BoC7goQAvD_BwE) bow so it would probably be more expensive to rehair than it's worth. Should I just get a new bow? If so, what would I be looking at for a budget of around £100? (I by no means need to use all of that unless I'm getting a lot of value out of it, but I'm not really willing to spend much more - I don't even know how much they cost and google isn't too helpful) How much getting used to will a new bow take?

I've also not replaced the strings in years, mostly because I haven't been playing, but I wasn't in the habit of it anyway - I don't think I've ever replaced the G (in over 10 years!) and to my ear it sounds fine. I have a full set of dominant strings and a nearly-full set of spares that have been sitting in the outside pocket of my violin case for years. The case has gone a bit musty, might the spare strings have gone ""bad"" or will they be okay? Should I change the strings now and get more spares? Should I try a different E string? I've only ever used dominants but it's a very-bright sounding violin (Westbury - alas the budget doesn't cover a new violin but I get away with it) anyway and I've heard the dominant E isn't the best, but I'm not sure if the different sound will throw me off.

Nothing fancy, we move quickly because a lot of it is intuitive to music majors. We played through the entire first essential elements book, and I can confidently play any piece from that book on any of the 4. 

My aunt caught wind of this and would like me to give her daughter, my cousin (10) violin lessons. 30-45 minutes once maybe twice a week. Because I am not a professional (far from it) violinist she doesn’t think she should need to pay since it’s “only a half hour a week” and it’s “valuable teaching experience.” 

I’m thinking like $10 a lesson. It *is* good experience for me, and I would love to do it, but I also feel like I should be able to charge a small fee for that. In high school my lessons were about $35 a week, pretty standard for my area.

My roommate is a professional singer, so the mic was nice enough to pick up the differences between them, but I do think that the differences are more apparent in real life. 

Warning: I am a beginner and I am just playing some very out-of-tune scales. The last bit is my roommate seeing what would happen if she turned on autotune - I can't edit it out so you can ignore that. [link to soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/dianeosaur/bow-trial)

The bows are as follows (in order of appearance): 
1. $400 new bow stamped M. Pereira - Brasil
2. Roommate's mystery antique bow, Priceless? Also missing half its hair.
3. $45 ""Viotti"" carbon fiber bow from Amazon. Mine.
4. $500 new bow stamped T. Chagas - Brasil
5. $100 antique bow stamped ""artist""
6. $300 antique bow
7. different $300 antique bow
8. $250 antique bow

I'm partial to #4. Of course, it's the most expensive, but in real life the sound difference is truly apparent and immediate. #7 and #8 are tied for somewhat distant second with #7 having a more ""austere"" sound to my ear. Then there's something about #5 that jumps out at me. It seems to ""match"" my violin, although I wonder if it's because it's a cheap bow and I'm used to hearing my violin played with a cheap bow, whereas the $500 bow made my violin sound so different I almost don't know how to compare it. My least favorite is #6, I just immediately knew I didn't like it.

I’ve done reading on vibrato simply because I was curious and had a general understanding that the two most common types were wrist and arm vibrato. I’d also seen mention of finger vibrato. When my teacher first brought it up I asked if I should start with arm or wrist vibrato and they said that there is no such thing as arm or wrist vibrato? That there is just vibrato and the different types aren’t a thing except with Russian violinists? When I was practicing I naturally just used my wrist but they said that was incorrect and I needed to use my whole arm. I’m just a bit confused since I’ve found lots of information about the different types and none referencing them as non existent or incorrect but I’d like to know other peoples perspectives or knowledge since people here have way more knowledge about this than I do.

I still don't get how to play the chords **NOT** rolled(as in grabbing the D A and E strings) for the part I put below. Every single time I try to play this, there's nothing but a crunching and squeaking sound. Whether I go through it gently or with more force, it always sounds like a cat being suffocated and no actual notes come out. My teacher told me to play this part with the part of bow near the frog because the hair is thicker and to apply force at the start of each note to grab the strings, but then quickly loosen up to prevent the crunching sound, but I really don't get this at all. I get what he's saying and sometimes after a bit of practice, I can kinda sorta maybe grab all 3 strings and play the 16th notes. However, the instant I try to connect this with a section before, I mess up every. Single. Time. Always. I just can't piece the previous part together and be able to produce a half-decent sound.

Right now semi-high me is wondering if this interest will continue after I'm sober. After looking some stuff up like ""why learn to play violin"" and getting hit with some facts like ""it will take years to play well"", ""there's a lot time dedicated to practicing"", ""Violin is one of the harder instruments to learn to play"", and ""anywhere from $200 to $10,000,000 for a good violin"", I wonder if I'll stick with it. I know its a lot of discipline (for any skill including this one) and I don't have a good track record with discipline, but I really do love the sound of violin. It can be passionate, smooth, somber, energetic, happy, angry, or anything in-between. I'm not a fan of classical music, but I love what more modern bands, games, and movie soundtracks have done with violin. Plus covers using violin sound pretty good too. I guess when I imagine myself playing an instrument it's playing one passionately like the violin. I feel like you don't look cool while playing the violin, but if I focus and feel the energy and passion of the music, I'll feel cool. Or like that would be end goals? Like my end goal would be to feel swept away in the music I'm playing and less ""I want to look cool and play for people."" Even like playing in an orchestra and being able to play a small part and contribute to the whole of a great musical piece sounds heavenly. 

Anyway, I want to know about the worst parts of beginning to play the violin. I want videos of beginners chords being played over and over to see if I can stand it (since I'll have to do them.) I want to know about the pain, the frustration, the times you almost gave up or realized this wasn't what you thought it'd be. I want my surface level violin fantasies broken and humbled so that I don't go into it with rose colored glasses. I figure if I know the roughest of it going in, then I can gauge whether or not I really want to stick with it. I have previous experience learning to play the piano growing up. But all the desire to play the piano vanished when I realized that all the songs I was playing were boring. I wasn't having fun. I don't want that to happen here. So I feel like my violin fantasies need to be brought back to earth for a real talk.

Maybe a computer model of the sound waves could be shown next to the instruments.

I come from a background of playing piano and wind instruments, so in my head staccato is always a bouncing feeling.  On piano, to play staccato I think « up » with my fingers.

Since I still struggle with reliably getting the next note *after* the staccato when I lift my bow, he says that I shouldn’t lift, but rather just produce the feel of staccato while leaving the bow on the strings.  I’ve been trying to figure this out, but since I’ve only had online lessons (we are still in lockdown where I am), I’m really struggling to figure out what it means to play staccato without lifting the bow.

I'm trying to learn Sibelius Violin Concerto in D. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever attempted (The next hardest I managed to learn was Bach's Toccata and Fugue arranged for violin by Stuart Carlson which has a lot of nasty double and triple stops)

I'm running into a problem where I'm looking at the music and seeing all these notes that are high as heck. Ordinarily I've managed to learn how to hit these notes correctly by ear - I know what the note is supposed to sound like so after a couple of goes my fingers learn where they need to be and the score is just there to give me a general sense of things. I know this is probably not a great way of doing things but it's how I get by - I haven't had a violin lesson since high school well over a decade ago and I only play for my own enjoyment.

However with Sibelius I'm really struggling to figure out what it's supposed to sound like because every recording I have of it (i) has a full orchestra backing it, (ii) is wickedly fast. 

Even more irritating when I do try to slow down the recording to 0.25 speed the vibrato get's really distracting and makes it even more difficult to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing.

Does anyone have a recording of someone going through Sibelius slowly - note by note?

I'm a violinist, I've been playing since childhood, albeit with interruptions and I'm exclusively a hobbyist. Recently, I've been listening to tons of contemporary Western classical music, like La Monte Young, Philip Glass, John Adams etc and I got interested in violins that have more than 4 strings. I think there is a small repertoire for these instruments, but nevertheless looks like it is available. I'm also a hobbyist composer, so I wanted to get my hands dirty with one of these non-standard violins to see if I can have some fun.

What I'm confused about is... There doesn't seem to be a consistent number of strings necessary for these instruments. Like I see compositions for 5 string violins, all the way up to 8 string violins. If I'm not mistaken 6 string seems to be the most frequently used by Western classical music composers and 6+ is used by rock/metal etc artists. But I'm not sure about this.

I'm guessing if I play one of these, my skills won't necessarily transfer to the other immediately, so it seems like I need to decide which one to learn... Especially given these instruments are relatively expensive. So if I buy a 6 string violin and start learning it, I don't want to realize a year later ""shoot there are really interesting pieces for 7 string"".

I’d forgotten some of the basics like giving her a cue, and how you have you make your instrument project much more, but it was just great to make music with someone again, and have that interplay going on. I don’t think I realised how much I missed it and I’m already looking forward to my next lesson. It makes such a difference playing with another person, rather than just a backing track.

Expert,1620225860,n5hkk1,"This is a bit of an odd (and long) post. I’m needing to rent an instrument for a couple of months due to an upcoming outdoor performance. This is my first actual in-person thing in a year (YAY) — but where I live, I’m super wary about using my instrument outside. If it was one night, I’d use mine, but it’s a two week run of Into the Woods.

My every-day instrument is an English violin from the mid-1700s and I’ve had issues in the past with it (the neck once released and I’m seeing the fingerboard start to drop a bit again) so I’m very worried about playing it outside in the July heat/humidity.

Spoke to my luthier today about a rental for the show and her rentals are Eastman 100s. She said the tone is not what I’m used to but I should come try them out at the end of the month. But that said, I wanted to come here and ask if it’s even worth renting. I’m concertmaster of our pit and I don’t want to have a crappy tone quality — especially since this is our first show in 16 months…

Music Major,1620067060,n43pqk,"First of all, thank you so very much to everyone who commented and gave me support and advice on my last post. Seriously, it means a lot to me. I get much better perspective and real advice from this forum than pretty much anyone irl. I didn’t respond to everyone, but I took every comment into careful consideration and I appreciate them all.

My jury happened this past Saturday. I did well, very well in fact. I haven't gotten the grade sheet back yet but I am confident it will be pretty good. I feel satisfied with my own performance which is really the most important thing. The buildup to that kind of thing is intense, as anyone who has ever done a high-pressure performance will know, so on top of the degree worries it made for a very stressful week. But it turned out well. 

This morning I had a meeting with my counselor/ department head/ aural skills prof/ whatever you want to call her. Her recommendation was that I do the general B.A. As it turns out, my violin teacher didn't quite know what she was talking about as far as the number of lessons, etc that a B.A. in music entails. It's much less rigorous than a B.M. Performance at many schools, but not mine. Apparently the only difference is that the B.M. Performance has 2 more semesters of chamber music, and 2 more semesters of piano required. There are more electives, and a bit more room for flexibility, even room to go for a second degree if you want, but the rigor is basically the same. You still play in orchestra, and still take lessons all 4 years. If I can win the audition, my counselor says, the B.A. degree is enough to get into pretty much anywhere for Grad school. The question, of course, would be whether I can win a Grad audition. She recommended that I investigate the Ed or Therapy degrees further since both are really good options if I want to be ""guaranteed"" a job (which of course I know it isn't a guarantee anyway). That I will do, and keep an open mind about. But to her, she said, the B.A. looked like a good option for me at this point. 

I’m much calmer now. I have the summer, and even most of the next school year, to consider things now which is good.

One thing I’ve realized- or rather one thing I’ve finally acknowledged, is that music and performance is standing in for a lot of things missing in my life. It’s how I find purpose. That’s why I’m so emotionally connected to it and why I feel a need to have it at the center of my life. I won't go into my situation but suffice it to say I don't feel like I have much of anything or anyone to latch onto, besides my love for music. I know it’s not healthy but I have to acknowledge what I’m dealing with mentally. Enough said about that.

I do think there's for sure a path for me into a music career if I choose to take it. It is probably not what I wanted originally but it would be something. I will need to refine my expectations for myself but it isn't necessary to give up the idea completely.  This is not a decision that's going to be made right away, it will take time. I'm continuing how I am for now, keeping multiple doors open.

I trust my teacher that not approving me for what I wanted was the best thing for me, even if it hurt. I have had a few problems in my dealings with her, simply because she is very, very tough. But honestly that's the best kind of teacher. Having high expectations, and sticking to them, is a good thing.  I feel like I did the best thing in choosing her for my teacher and for that and several other reasons I don't think it would be wise to switch teachers or schools at this point.",violinist,Update on my career struggles,,1

When I play a friends violin I instantly notice the brightness and clarity of their instrument. When I play my violin I can hear a faint buzzing noise and the tone is really muddy and muffled even when playing on open strings.

Student,1620027940,n3qlz7,"TLDR: I think I'm playing quite well for my level, musicians agree, most others are underwhelmed.

So I'm an adult beginner who has been playing for about 2.5 years now. Corona has somewhat slowed my progress (as violin lessons via Zoom are just not the same as 1:1 lessons), but I'm quite pleased with my progress so far. I practice around 3-5 hours per week. Yeah, it could be more, but at least that's consistent. My intonation and sound is quite good for 2.5 years (although not perfect by any means, of course), I can play in 1st and 3rd position and switch positions in an ok manner. My teacher says my progress is great. Musician friends say my progress is great. I'm playing Rieding op. 36, Shostakovic's ""Die aufgezogene Puppe"" and the Kindertrio by Klengel at the moment, plus Etudes to work on my technique. I also like working on traditional tunes, although I can't go much faster than 100 bmp yet with those (think ""Drowsy Maggie"", ""Dunmore Lassies"" or ""Devil Among the Tailors""). 

So I know  it is important to play for others to overcome stage fright and to get used to comfortably play with other people present, so I usually jump at every possibility to play when someone says ""and how are you doing with your violin lessons?"" With Corona, these possibilities are scarce enough, and I prefer ""live performances"" to recording myself, as I think my phone camera produces a very scratchy violin sound that is definitily much worse than what I actually play (had friends confirm that, so it's not only in my head :D) So the problem is that 90% of the times I play for non-musicians, even if I liked my performance myself, they're usually like ""yeah well.... you still have a lot to learn."" If I play for musician friends they're usually over the moon ""Wow that is sooo good for 2 years, that's great progress, can't believe you're already playing that!"" Pre-Corona, I even played with some of them in a ""private jam session"" kind of setting once, so I guess it can't be that bad, right? But I can't do this at the moment because they live far away and there are still quite strict lockdown restrictions.

But that look of disappointment really hurts me. Yesterday neighbours came over for a coffee and asked about my progress, I told them how it is and they asked to hear something. Afterwards, one commented in a polite manner, but looked rather underwhelmed. The other said ""yeah I know that it's a lot of work and I'm impressed how consistent and patient you are with practice but it really takes MANY years for a violin to sound enjoyable for others"". Bam, self-confidence crushed again. When I started, I just wanted to have fun playing and learning, I am proud of what I have already achieved, but this is really getting to me and it triggers some really ""traumatic"" memories from the past. I had piano lessons as a kid/teenager for like 10 years and always had the feeling I was getting on people's nerves when I was practicing and I needed to play perfectly at recitals or it just wasn't good enough. Once botched up a recital (just the end-of-school year recital of our music school, which wasn't prestigious AT ALL) and my mom told me she was ashamed to admit I was  her daughter. My dad usually said after a recital he ""earned a drink now after listening to all this"". 20-25 years later, that still haunts me. (No, neither me nor my parents are Asian and my parents didn't really play instruments either.) 

Well I guess I'm just not really sure how to proceed. Just don't play for others unless I know the feedback will be okay and fair? But when will be the point where people might be willing to tolerate or even kinda enjoy my playing? Can any of you relate to this or do I just need to develop a thicker skin? And how do I do that?

Amateur,1619947813,n32wiv,"I'm not sure if other people are aware this is even happening, but this is a HUGE pet peeve of mine.  Most people know that a track on a classical music CD is the result of tens of takes and the artistry of an audio engineer stitching the best parts of those takes together.  In no way are CD recordings representative of what a human is capable of doing in one take.  I have come to accept this.

What really pisses me off though are videos of live performances, which imply to the viewer that it's all a single take with very little doctoring done other than maybe editing out coughing or adjusting reverb or balancing or something.  *This is not the case at all.*  Most if not all professionally recorded videos on youtube are doctored in tons of ways.  There are varying degrees of fakery being performed and some of them are extremely shameless.

The biggest trick is to use multiple cameras.  This allows you to cut from camera to camera.  So a performer could record a section on one camera angle, doing tons of takes until they get it perfect.  Then they record with another camera angle on the next section.  In editing, you stitch the two together and most people aren't aware that it isn't a single take because of the cut between the two camera angles.  If you're one of those people who catches inconsistencies in movies because it was filmed out of order, you probably notice these things.  Their head is turned in slightly different ways between cuts or a bead of sweat is present in one shot but not the other.  There are lots of giveaways to this sort of thing, but it's usually subtle.  Overall, this is, in my opinion, the least egregious kind of faking live playing depending on the context.  E.g. Hadelich's at-home videos are recorded like this.

But Geige, you say, you can only do that in certain situations and definitely not in a concerto with a live orchestra or something.  You say that, but you're wrong, sadly.  Now we're getting more egregious, in my opinion.  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UTq1eZrDkI) was what made me ragequit youtube today and write this post.  I was trying to get some inspiration for practicing and ended up just having a very angry practice session (although Bach made me feel quite a bit better).  Starting at 5:42 we get a very, very close shot.  The background is oddly pitch black suddenly... The last frame in this shot at 5:47 has Ray with his head turned over the violin and eyes open looking down the fingerboard.  It cuts back to a farther away shot.  In the first frame of the new shot, the orchestra magically reappears and Ray has his eyes closed with his head facing the audience.  If you know what to look for, these tricks are EVERYWHERE not just in this video, but in pretty much every other professionally recorded video like this.  I assume what they do is just have Ray get back on stage without the orchestra and record the tricky parts until he nails them, then they edit them in?  I don't actually know.  I don't mean to pick on Ray Chen here, this was just most immediate example to me since I had just watched it.  I promise your favourite soloist is doing this kind of thing too because I see it all the time.  There are other issues with this particular video, but I just pointed out that particular shot because it nicely illustrates one faking technique.

And sadly, that isn't even the most shameless kind of fakery.  The worst is when videos have other audio overlaying a video.  But even for very consistent violinists, each take tends to be unique.  If you really carefully watch vibrato and bow changes, you can see when things don't quite match up.  Sometimes things really, really don't match up.  I was watching a violin soloist on Digital Concert Hall a while back.  I had missed the live stream of the concert, so after a couple of weeks, it was finally added to the archive (ever wonder why it takes a while sometimes for videos to be archived?).  I was watching the video and there was a moment where the violinist had a perfectly still left hand, yet you heard a big, juicy soloist vibrato.  I rewound the video to watch the note multiple times because I couldn't believe just how flagrant the error was.  I let my subscription to that service lapse.  I'm hesitant to post any big name examples of this, but usually editors do a pretty good job hiding this sort of thing.  For me, vibrato is always the biggest thing that gives it away.  [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/violinist/comments/mb50y0/it_amazes_me_how_much_can_be_done_on_just_four/) was posted here recently.  I'm not actually convinced that we're hearing *anything* that guy played.  It honestly seems like he's miming all of it because there are so many discrepancies everywhere not just in vibrato but everything.  This faking technique is also surprisingly common even with big names, probably even more often in live orchestra situations.  I'm pretty sure certain shots are used of the performer like say from behind the back or a very wide view of the whole orchestra and then you can't see that the hands don't perfectly match up with the audio.

These are just a few faking techniques.  There are others and probably a bunch that I don't even notice and am not aware of.  When you combine all of these techniques, audio engineers and editors have tremendously many options to make a performer seem like they're actually playing what we're hearing.

I honestly find all of this so frustrating I hardly watch violin youtubes anymore.  At this point, I pretty much just assume everything is heavily edited and I go hunting for discrepancies between the audio and video, which just kills my enjoyment especially when I find them, which is most of the time.  I just put them on as audio because I treat them now the same way I treat audio CDs.  They're idealized versions of the pieces that could never be played so well live, despite the whole charade.

I sympathize with performers nowadays.  People expect recordings-- even live recordings-- to be perfect now.  It's just not a realistic expectation, and I guess performers are just giving people what they want.  I don't know.  I would much rather hear what they actually played, even if it's not perfect.  I'm sure Ray has performed the Saint-Saens I&amp;R tons of times.  Why doesn't he just upload whichever performance he likes the most?  Again, I'm just using Ray as a stand-in for all professional performers who do this sort of thing.

I'm curious if other people have noticed this?  Or perhaps just noticed something was ""off"" in some videos.  I'm also curious if anyone here knows any of the dirty details about these types of things?

I started practicing the violin on January this year. I wanted to record my progress. I bought a Samson Q2U mic after watching many reviews. Everyone said it was a great mic for streaming, recording instruments, podcasting, etc, so I bought it. I was appalled that I spent almost 100€ for a mic that sounds like a gramophone.

I've found out about the Zoom H5, which are quite expensive, a Rode NT, which I felt it wasn't great, and even the Blue Yet. I want something simple, USB, easy to use. No XLRs or anything too complicated. Do you have any suggestions?

,1619824269,n25u70,"     Hello! I am a student who is currently in orchestra, and I am about to enter high school this upcoming August. A couple of months ago, I decided that I did not want to continue playing my violin anymore. I play with the highest level orchestra at my school, but being in orchestra always increases my anxiety and stresses me out. My class is composed of people who have either been practicing their string instrument since they were small, now almost playing their instrument to perfection, and people who are just naturally gifted with the ability to play music on a string instrument. I do not fit into either of those categories, haha! I began playing in 6th grade, (I am currently finishing 8th grade), just because I thought playing the violin would be cool. I think part of why I was so adamant on quitting this year is because I wish I could play better, but I can’t even though I take playing violin very seriously and practice much. This thought worsened as I was placed in an orchestra with some of the most advanced students. I felt, and still feel, like a joke! I know you guys can’t hear me play, but I hope you understand what I’m saying. 
     Now, here’s why I’m in two minds about this situation. Last year, I became infatuated with theater and acting. Acting became a dream of mine that I am still determined to keep doing. I love everything that revolves around acting and theater. I started acting classes, and was excited to quit orchestra so I could pursue theater at my high school. There are only 3 elective slots at my high school, and two of mine are taken up by required electives. I have already chosen theater, but I can easily change it to Orchestra if I change my mind, that’s what my orchestra teacher told me. Everything was fine, I was going to put down the violin, and begin the journey of theater and acting. Until the guilt hit me. This is where I need help. Though I had said that orchestra stresses me out, I feel like if I kept practicing my violin, it could become something I could master. There’s just something in me that wants to keep playing the violin! I feel like I’m wasting the ability to develop a musical skill. Plus, just being able to say I can play the violin really well would be cool. Unfortunately, I still want to do theater too! I wish I could do both theater and orchestra, and I can, just once I become a sophomore, that’s when the required electives will be gone.     
     I’m having horrible trouble trying to make a decision on whether I should just stop orchestra now, or just do theater in sophomore year once I have extra electives. If I could get some helpful detailed input, that would be very much appreciated!

,1619747073,n1jluc,"Hi all, in school orchestra my conductor is always telling me to play louder. Its a very small orchestra, with only a couple violins, a viola, and 4 cellos, though. I play second violin (I might as well be the only second violin as the only other is almost always at home so they can't play with us, then they play very softly anyways). 

Although my conductor is always telling me to play louder, and she can't hear me at all, or she can barely here me. I try to play as loud as I can, by using my entire bow for even short notes, all right in the middle of the bridge and fingerboard, and sometimes if I don't need to worry about dynamics or anything else I'll even press my bow into the string so that anymore and it would start crunching, and she'll still say to play louder/she can barely hear me/etc. She will even come over and press my bow into the string and tell me to play and it crunches so much the whole way and then will say that's how much I need to press down, although I don't actually do that of course because then I would sound like a dying cat. 

I've asked my private teacher how i should play louder and she just said the main thing I should do is just make sure I am playing in that sweet spot between the bridge and fingerboard, and if I want to play even louder to just use more bow, but I shouldn't be squeezing with my index finger on my bow, and she will also tell me to stop squeezing in with my bow lots of the time playing solo stuff because it gives a scratchy/unclean noise. She has also never commented on me playing to quietly, although I guess she wouldn't really be able to notice as we have been on facetime for the past several months. 

I would be thinking the reason my orchestra conductor can't hear me is because we have 4 cellos who are all pretty loud, although the first violin has no problem playing way above everyone else. Their part part is usually higher, although even when I also share solo parts with them I still can't seem to play above everyone else. We just recorded a concert and I watched the video and I could barely hear myself even when I had a solo, though I could easily make out the cellos and first violin. 

Is there anything I should be doing differently? Or is it possible that my violin just isn't very loud? Although it is a somewhat nice strad copy, and I know strads were made to be played above an entire orchestra. Or could it also be a bow problem? I haven't had my bow rehaired in several years (I know, very bad :( I plan on doing that in the next week if I get time), but I can't imagine that would make me so quiet.

I used to play violin from 4th grade to 1st year in college. I could hold my own in Uni orchestra and the Jr Phill but I was never fantastic and between never getting virbrato to 'click' and some life issues, I stopped playing.

But I just feel absolutely BORED to tears. At least give me a *few* songs or exercises. No, just ONE song with ONE single way to play at ONE line at a time. I have been looking at some old study books for exercises about w/e he wants me to study just to give me some darn variety of what to play.

I am a huge fan of the price carnival of the animals: the swan, and I have been looking for a simpler, easier version for me to play for a while. I want to learn the original piece eventually, but right now, I know I am not capable of it. 

I thought I had found the perfect music sheet, but turns out it is for cello. I didn't find any other that was easy looking, and I really don't want to try a harder piece to just get myself stressed, so I figured I'd ask here if it is even possible.

,1619650315,n0qzv9,"I'm new to violin. But I have some experience on guitar, and I've been wanting to pick up the instrument for years, so I've decided that I'd like to spend the extra money on an intermediate instrument straight away, instead of taking my chances on a student grade violin that might play poorly and push me away from the art.

My local shop owner seems to be trustworthy as far as I can tell. He comes off as very highly intelligent, and definitely has a passion for the craft. He says he's been making instruments for 40 years, and says he enjoys upgrading mass-manufactured instruments and reselling them at a modest markup in addition to the ""professionals only"" tier of instruments he builds himself.

I listened to him play one of his own instruments, and I can say at least based on my limited knowledge that it sounded incredible to me. The sound was full and rich, as good as any instrument I've heard in studio recordings. He says his instruments sell starting at $10,000, which I'd say is pretty reasonable if it plays as good as it sounds.

He has an Angel Taylor V420 for sale. He says it's a model that he has personally torn down and reworked top to bottom. It's a little glassier sounding than his top end hand crafted specimen, but still sounds pretty good. I play electric guitar, and the fingering feels about as light as my $2,500 solid body electric - which is much lighter than I expected - and doesn't appear to buzz or have any other issues. Honestly it plays as smoothly as I would have ever expected having never played violin before.

He says if he charged the going rate on the labor he put into the modifications he made to it, the labor would be worth about $1,500 alone. He says from a playability perspective, he set it up to play as well as his best hand crafted instruments, and that I'd only ever want to upgrade from this instrument if I went professional and/or wanted into the absolute upper echelons of sound quality.

Everything about this feels right at first blush. The guy seems honest, and his passion seems genuine. He's got multiple instruments in various state of construction in his shop, and he says he's currently training an apprentice luthier in his shop. I can't find a negative review on the guy anywhere on the internet.

But he's charging $1,000 for an instrument that retails between $800 and $1,200 based on the few listings I've found for the model. It just seems too good to be true that he's put $1,500 worth of labor into an instrument, only to sell it for basically the middle of the retail price range.

But I honestly can't tell one way or the other, because the instrument sounds great and plays phenomenally well as far as I can tell. There's one small blemish in the finish at the bottom from where a different chin rest was originally installed by the manufacturer, and I think maybe the manufacturer didn't let the varnish dry completely before attaching the factory chin rest. Otherwise the instrument seems literally flawless to my untrained eye.

,1619585403,n077n7,"I've been playing/taking lessons for about 9 months now. My violin was gifted to me by my mom a few years ago, and I know she probably spent a couple hundred on it. I know it's a student violin (cremona SV 130 and the cheapo bow it came with) and I know I'm not gonna be playing on it forever, but right now it still is good for my skill level I think. 

However, I recently changed my strings to the D'Addario helicore medium tension. I think I had preludes both of the other times I changed them, so I thought upgrading would be good and give me a bit of a different sound. So far, I hate them. 

I don't know if it's just me or of it's the strings and how soft they seem, or if it's my bow, or maybe even both. It seems like I have to heavily rosin every time I play and they still have a weird screechy sound that my previous strings didn't have. Or maybe not as much? I don't know. But it's horrific, and frustrating when I'm practicing cuz it sounds so bad. It seems like the only things I'm able to play well are slower songs, or ones that are fairly simple. 

I'm working on suzuki book 2 and I'm on the long ago variation, and it sounds fine when I'm going slower, but as soon as I speed up tempo it starts to get that weird screechy scratchy sound and my bow doesn't want to grip the strings it feels like, even after rosining a bunch. I've had them on for at least 2 weeks, so it's not for lack of new strings. I practice for an hour minimum 3-4 times a week, and then I have hour long lessons once a week.

I think maybe I need to upgrade my bow, but I'm not sure really what to look for. I want to have a good quality/nice one so that when I do finally upgrade my instrument, it will pair nicely with an intermediate violin.

Music Major,1619543086,mzt6i8,"Yeah, this post got really long. It was intended to be a simple question to anyone who's been in this situation, what should I do. But it turned into a rant. 

*TL;DR My prof just told me she's not going to recommend me to go for a BM music performance, and that I'm behind due to only getting really serious in high school. I don't want to give up the plan of going to grad school and going for a music career, but I don't have much of a desire to get a music education or therapy degree. I'm at a low point, questioning if I'm even good enough.* 

So, I'm a music major. I'm not at a conservatory, but the university I go to has a very high-level music program that is almost conservatory-equivalent.

Some of you may remember my post from months ago where I got absolutely ripped apart in my first lesson of the semester. I successfully moved on and turned it into motivation to do better. I have prepared a couple of pieces over the semester and my playing has improved a lot, even my teacher has said so several times. I recently had a very good performance in studio.

That's why I was completely unprepared for what happened in my lesson yesterday. It was the last lesson of the semester, with juries in only a few days. My prof and I were talking about repertoire and goals for next semester. Now, at my school, as at most I'm sure, Freshmen start out taking basic music classes, and then choose the degree (performance, education, therapy, composition, or general B.A.) that they want to go into. They have to be approved by private teachers and other faculty to continue in the program they choose.  I filled out the form and put in the degree I've wanted to work towards from the start, a performance degree. I didn't think it would be a problem. But my prof just told me that she doesn't feel comfortable approving me to move forward in that, and wants me to do education or therapy.

The whole conversation has left me upset and confused. She started out by saying that she didn't want me to leave school with no guaranteed job, even if I wind up going on to grad school for music, which she knows I plan to. Yeah, I get it, music isn't exactly the easiest field to find a job in. I've heard all the statistics, and I'm probably crazy for even trying. But I thought I could go on to do what the grad students I'm in ensemble with are doing, teaching and gigging and playing for small orchestras while they prepare for the big auditions and get their masters degrees. From there, there are many paths one can take. My teacher said that you can't teach unless you have an Ed degree, which I didn't think was true. I mean, she's been teaching students of various ages for years and she doesn't have an Ed degree. Even some fellow undergrads I know have students already. Maybe she just meant you can't teach for a living without an Ed degree? Is that true?

Another thing my prof said is, I think, closer to the real reason she won't approve me. She told me again what she mentioned that first lesson, that I'm ""a little bit behind"" for someone who wants to make a career out of being a musician. I told her about my background, that I've played my whole life but only really got serious about in in high school, and didn't practice as much as I should have in elementary and middle school. I only knew I wanted to be a music major once I hit my Junior year. I was a kid, I had not yet found the passion for music that I have now. She said she understands, but ""that's a bit too late"". I can't do anything about it now, so is the answer just to give up? I suppose I'm simply not good enough in her eyes to even get an undergrad performance degree. But I'm still a Freshman. It's not like I'm going to graduate this year. I have time to keep improving, don't I? 

I just don't understand her reasons for this. According to her I've improved so much, then suddenly I'm so behind I can't even go for my degree? I need to get into a program that will land me a job in the music industry, but it's too late for me to make a career out of music at all? I can go to grad school, but I'm not going to make it after undergrad? I'm so confused. Is everything else she said just meant to sugarcoat the simple fact that she thinks I'll never be good enough? 

I have worked very hard, it's definitely not that I'm lazy. There's always another hour of practice that it feels like could be done, always the guilt when I have a bad day. But I thought I was doing well. I have learned the right amount of practice to be at my most productive and I've hardly slacked off once. I'm doing all my ensemble and solo rep and scales and etudes- everything I should be doing. What else, honestly, \*can\* I do? Am I lying to myself that I'm doing well, or that I'm even any good at all? Am I actually lazy? Am I just bad at this? 

Moving forward, I don't quite know what to do. I need to try and focus on doing well at my jury, whatever happens. I have a meeting set up with one of my aural professors who also acts as a career counselor, someone I would trust with absolutely anything. I'm going to tell her about the situation in full detail and see what she thinks my options are. I will see if it really is impossible for me to do the performance degree.  After that, I suppose I have a tough choice to make. I don't want to do education or therapy. I really don't have an interest in either program. The general B.A. in music does not allow for private lessons all 4 years, which if I want any chance to get into a grad school I have to have. I am once again considering  switching teachers or even schools, but if \*I'm\* the problem what good is that going to do? Besides, I \*was\* feeling good about how this school and prof is working for me. Should I just give up being a music major? I don't know, but the thought of that really hurts.  I still feel like I would never be happy doing anything else. I'm not ready to give it up.",violinist,More private teacher struggles,,1

It hurt when I rotated it backwards at all, like to close a door behind me, hitch up my pants, or hold a small child. When I wasn't doing that, it didn't hurt, but did feel weird, kind of dead.

I gave it a rest for a few days and then went back to playing. It only hurts a little afterwards but my playing is very stodgy, I guess because I don't want to hurt my shoulder again so I'm afraid to play freely.

So this violin was thrown out in the box, and it's really beat up. There's no bow (Sorry, I don't know about violins, the stick piece that you make the sound with)  
It says Stainer on the back of the curly top part and inside (the back panel is completely detached) seemed to be some text but I can only make out '16' clearly. After googling about Stainer who lived in the 1600s I got really excited that it may be really so old!   
I did my best to take good photos, following instructions on violin photography posted on this sub.  
There's a small crack if you face the violin. It's to the lower left of the left  f shaped hole and about 3 cm, but if you push gently it's not noticeable.   
On the lower part that holds the strings is a flower decoration with the initials of I.M. Google didn't really help with this and then I thought maybe this violin belonged to someone with these initials.  
I know asking here isn't as good as visiting a shop but every one of you already know more about violins than I do.   
Could it really be from the 1600s?  
Could it be fixed?   
Is there anything I can do?   
I read somewhere about loosening the strings but I don't know anything and I don't want to damage it further.  
I'm not interested in the value! I know there are many copies of violins and it probably isn't worth much if it's thrown in the garbage. I think the only answers that would disappoint me is ""It's not old at all."" or ""It can't be fixed, it's best to discard it"".

,1619465741,mz5ybr,"I’ve been playing the viola for 7, almost 8 years now and recently I decided to pick up the violin for the heck of it. Here’s my 100% absolutely professional opinion of your instrument.

1. The violin is tiny, but in a good way. I have some shoulder issues stemming from playing an instrument that quite frankly, may be a little bit too big for me. The violin is so small and light that if my shoulder is bothering me, I still have an instrument I can play! The size is super weird but I love it. I was really concerned when I first picked up the violin case and noticed how light it was. Turns out, that’s just how it is.

2. It’s really... screechy but no quite? It has a different tone quality from the viola. I now know why my orchestra director fusses at the violin section when they play an open E string. I probably need to work out how hard to press the bow.

3. You guys have zero excuses to not use your fourth finger. It’s not that big of a stretch. You’ll be fine. Your fingers are closer together and your stings aren’t as thick. Just play using a fourth finger, it sounds better.

4. It’s easier to find music. This is what I’ve been jealous of for a super long time. 

5. All my violist friends are preparing to disown me. 

6. My treble clef has really been improving. I occasionally have to read it for the viola, but I’ve never been very good at it. It’s probably a good thing to be able to read at least one of the common clefs and I don’t think alto clef counts.

7. Some problems are universal. I’m allergic to nickel, the material in the metal part of the chin rest. Exact same problem on the violin as on my viola. My bow still bounces. I still have trouble saving my bow.

,1619414556,myqd37,"It’s almost a cliche saying that we want to bow with “weight” rather than “pressure”. As someone who has a good amount of experience with bowing, I find this concept is even harder to explain than to actually do it. 

Just for example, I once tried to objectively (in my best effort) observe myself while I was playing a simple melody, I have the following messy findings: 

1. I almost feel no weight at the point of bow change. Even at the frog. Or put in another way, most of the momentum caused by bow change are absorbed by fingers before the bow re-engages the string.  

2. What matters more however is the *timing* you start to engage weight; in my case it is “right after” bow change, or the moment the bow starts to engage the string, after the bow change action “settled”. 

3. The weight engagement across from frog to tip is not only not uniform, but wildly uneven; on down bow it tends to feel the heaviest on 1/3 upper bow, on up bow almost always the tip receives the heaviest push and then dying away to a sliver. This produces the sound I like. At this point I start to remember in my distant past teacher’s advice to apply “even weight”/ “heavier towards to tip” across the full bow length, and I never seem to get the desired results. 

4. A random insight: If we are to apply an even (whatever it is weight or speed) approach to any bowing, it is almost always only going to sound “okay”. To draw a good sound, such parameters tends to be uneven in a certain way across the full bow. Yet this secret sauce has seldom been distilled into rules of thumb in a systematic/ pedagogical way? 

5. Are weight and pressure actually *that* different? With soft fingers, much of the force (wherever it comes from wrist or arm) gets absorbed effectively and would only produce a slightly rough sound at worst ? Is finger flexibility rather the actual key variable here? 


After all, I am aware of the limitations of language, it is a terrible medium to accurately describe actual physiological processes. Therefore when we give advices/ evaluate ourselves, we sometimes also rely on sensuality-based statements (“as if you are resting your arm slightly onto the instrument”). How effective it is to different individuals however, is still questionable. We do feel things differently and therefore interpret that target feel also differently. Therefore, I am in a constant search and thinking on: how do we distill the physiology of bowing better (somewhat better than “more speed/weight” perhaps?) , even though it is actually very complicated?",violinist,What do we actually mean when we talk about “weight” on the bow arm,,1

My violin teacher said to me that C-major is one of the most important scales to know. He explained it as sort of like a base. I'll be honest, my music theory knowledge was super rusty when he was explaining it to me so I didn't catch a lot of it. I do remember that the more sharps you add, the more flats you add as well (or at least that is what I think is correct).

On the piano, there is a half step on the B and C, and E and F. It's easier to see it. Kind of confusing on the violin as well.

I've come into possession of a 1923 Gustav Henning 4/4 violin (#27x out of only possibly 557 total he made in his life) that is in need of some major repairs; new bridge, new tuners on the tailpiece, probably a complete clean and redo of the top finish (it almost looks like rosin has been caked onto the top under a layer of varnish?). There is also a crack on the top shoulder that looks like it has been poorly fixed in the past. 

There's an interesting blurb about this particular luthier [here](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_605501) in the National Museum of American History (NMAH) - this particular instrument was made during his time in Colorado.

I'm a classical guitarist by training who has dabbled in cello over the years so, after restoration, I would: a) happily use this as motivation to start learning the violin and use this as my first instrument; b) if it turns out to be more deserving of a skilled violinist (seems unlikely), help it find a more deserving home.

I was scrolling by and saw a post Coldplay was promoting for Viva La Vida and was instantly taken back to when I first began looping. Viva La Vida was my FIRST loop creation in 2009 so it holds a special place in my heart to this day

I then thought about my version and how many people that I may have inspired throughout my career and it hit me. I remember logging on to YouTube to see one of my favorite violinist at the time David Garrett announcing a new creation on a pedal board.

There I was in 2013 watching as you, one of my musical icons, began mimicking me without so much as a credit during the intro (I don’t speak German, please correct me). People in my inner circle were upset and I kept defending you in hopes of a shout-out or credit. No one on the web during that time period had my style of looping or had been captured performing the track live in public as extensively as I.

There are so many accounts from People of Color whose inventions or ideas have been stolen, or work minimized, only to be credited when it’s too late. I give you the opportunity to own up or clarify how you got into the Looping Genre and Who inspired you? 

I knew way back then what you (or your team) had done to my career as yours has bled into mine, I’m just curious if YOU are.

,1619254776,mxg5s3,"This post partially inspired by the ‘Evolution of violin’ post.

For years now I always tend to catch when a Classical instrument is in a popular song on the radio, and it makes me think back to when I was learning to play viola decades ago. If my teacher back then had me try to figure out a country version “Pictures of You” by The Cure (heard it at a festival, it was great) instead of Dvorak, I would have been far more interested and practiced more. And now, as an adult that hasn’t played in decades, I can hire a teacher and tell them just that. 

As for choosing an instrument to learn to play now, I mostly want to play with the gathering of friends I have, a few of which are in bands and all that. While we all sit around a fire at a BBQ or on the beach, they all say to pick up the guitar or ukulele, easy to learn, etc. But... They already all play guitar and ukulele, they don’t need a new one In the group.

So I want to be different and my past viola experience now makes me think of picking it up again. But from what I remember, and now have read a tiny bit about, is that a viola on its own really is mainly a harmony/back of the band kind of instrument. Whereas a 5-string violin/viola has a broader range, and I’d be able to play most anything from bluegrass/country to rock and alternative with my friends or alone. And a fretted 5-string might be easier to learn on.

I don’t think I’d take a nice wooden violin out to the beach for a night around a fire, but there are composite and other types of materials. And the electric violins out there would be my next step-up, I’m sure (or can one play an electric without an amp around the fire?). I just want to have fun with my friends and do something a bit different, both of which will motivate me to practice more.

So... with that, I am tall with long arms and wonder if I could manage a 5-string viola. It might make life easier with more space for that 5th string. Any recommendations for sizes, and even where to begin to look to get one? I am in Europe and I know there is a violin shop in town, but maybe I can order something more suitable online To learn on. Do they sell 5-string viola/violin string sets, or is that something I have to piece together?

I guess I should ask those of you who do play 5-string violins about your experience?

Adult Beginner,1619249049,mxexuf,"Hi everybody!

After some recent posts concerning baroque bows, baroque music, etc. etc., I was tempted to look a bit more closely into the history of the violin and its evolution. “I know that I know nothing”, as the saying goes, but I don’t particularly feel that ignorance is bliss, so I fired up my computer, opened my browser, wrote “history of the violin” into google and…. was quickly overwhelmed. Too many fancy looking websites, all with an air of validity to them, too many articles that never really addressed what I was looking for, too much of everything. 

So, why not ask here, I said to myself, in the sub of all subs (if you’re thinking that I’m trying to ingratiate myself with you, then I must tell you, you’re most certainly wrong. Never could I ever.)

So, first of all, what do I know? Not much really. I know that if we ignore for a second all its many ancestors, the violin’s history starts around the 16th century. It underwent significant changes (baroque to modern?) in the 18th century. And so did the bow. However, this one seems more complicated. I encountered baroque bows such as the Italian Sonata bows and French bows, transitional bows and, finally, the modern bow. So, you see… it’s not very much. Wikipedia could tell you that (which it did; my google search included the words “violin”, “violin bow” and “Wikipedia”, in case you were wondering). 

So, what exactly am I asking? It seems all very removed from the title of this post. If I wanted a book about the history of the violin, just, you know, ask. But be patient, I’m getting there.

Since my knowledge is basic at best, I must assume that the instrument evolved with the music that was written for it, and then in turn the music evolved with the instrument, given all the new possibilities it presented. If this assumption is faulty, please don’t be afraid to correct me. 

This realization in turn led me to the following question:

What does the future look like for the violin? While technical development has increased exponentially over the last few decades, some argue that human evolution has not, as we are externalizing “our need to adapt”. Rather than having to change ourselves, machines do it for us, and in some cases evolutionary accomplishments, like women with wider hips to maximize the chance of a successful birth, might even revert, thanks to modern achievements like C-sections (meaning, women with narrower hips, who had a higher chance of dying during childbirth along with their babies are now able to pass on their genes). 

So? Will the violin's evolution be externalized as well? Does the future lie in post-production? Or will our current violin eventually become something akin to what baroque violins are today - a fancy and no doubt beautiful relic of the past, but still a relic played only by a relatively small minority. How would its successor look like? And if we somehow manage to hold on to it, coming back to my earlier assumption of how instrument and music are related to each other, what does that mean for future music specifically composed for the violin? Obviously, new techniques have emerged, and people are experimenting a lot with what they’re given (I must admit, I’m not all that familiar with new things written for the violin), but eventually we just might hit a wall here. So, will music stagnate as well? I can’t imagine that.

So… where *are* things going?

**Tl;dr: What’s gonna happen to violin-chan?**

If you have any meaningful literature that might give some insight into the violin – past, present, or future – I would definitely welcome it. Online is fine, but I’m more of a print kind of girl. I just love the smell of books and the sound of rustling paper.

So, now it’s time for me to go to bed, but I’m looking forward to your comments, no matter how crazy, random or out of place they might seem.

Hi all! Long story short: I'm a lifelong guitar player who acquired a new (or very lightly used) violin about 15 years ago and basically never used it save for a few very short spurts of activity. I think it's a Lidl 26 series. I just opened it back up after probably 5-8 years and have some questions about what I should do. For background, it's been in its case in my parents' basement (well-insulated, no temp/dryness issues) basically forever. Also, I had no idea how to care for the instrument at those various moments of inspiration, but it always went safely back into its case after use. I did NOT wipe rosin off the bow or strings after those moments either. Anyway, here are my questions:

Strings: I assume getting a fresh set of strings on there is a good idea. Was leaning towards D'Addario Prelude. Good call?

Bow (Glasser): Should I just buy a new one? Is there a go-to affordable but not crappy option? Should I see if I can wipe off the old rosin? 

Body: Anything I should check to make sure it's not in need of any major maintenance? I understand I could bring it to a luthier, but I'm a tinkerer, and this isn't exactly a fancy instrument, so please indulge my impulse to DIY my entire life when possible.

There are so many variables! My teacher recommended Dominant synthetic. I thought that would be simple enough, but looks like there's a lot more to it. For example, [this set](https://www.amazon.com/JSI-Special-Violin-String-Set/dp/B000V6FY8Q/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=dominant&amp;qid=1619149499&amp;s=musical-instruments&amp;sr=1-4):

&gt;Full Set includes   
Pirastro Gold Label Plain Steel Loop-End E,   
Thomastik Dominant Aluminum Wound Perlon Core Ball-End A,   
Thomastik Dominant Aluminum Wound Perlon Core Ball-End D,   
Thomastik Dominant Silver Wound Perlon Core Ball-End G

Why is the E steel when the rest are synthetic? And even a different brand apparently? Why do some have ball ends and some have loop ends? Why are some aluminum and some silver? 

[This description](https://fiddlershop.com/collections/violin-string-sets/products/dominant-violin-set) seems more straightforward:

&gt;Dominant series violin strings are one of the most widely-used synthetic strings. A highly flexible, multi-strand nylon core makes these comparable in sound and feel to natural gut. The E string is aluminum/steel or plain steel, ball or loop end.

But again, why is the E string different? And which one should I get?

I'm also looking at the [Dominant Pro string set](https://fiddlershop.com/collections/violin-string-sets/products/thomastik-dominant-pro-violin-string-set). 

&gt;We're delighted to introduce Thomastik Dominant Pro Violin Strings, a new and improved version of the original classic, designed for the modern professional performer.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Dominant Pro has a familiar tone that players can immediately recognize from the regular Dominant set. However, the Pro version provides greater volume, wider dynamic range, and a finer color pallette to draw from.

The full description is long but it sounds incredible. However I'm not sure if ""pro"" means, like, ""deluxe,"" or if it means ""harder to play well."" Probably both? One thing that's different is it has lower tension. I'm not sure what that entails.

But my biggest question is, how do they get on my violin? Is it difficult to do by yourself if you don't know what you're doing, but you have a good tutorial? If I buy from a music shop, will they string it for me? Can I ask my violin teacher or is that weird?",violinist,Questions about strings: where to buy? synthetic or steel? ball or loop?

,1619142720,mwkhof,"I know this sub gets questions like this addressed weekly, but really I don't think ""the elephant in the room"" is ever addressed. Seriously, can we address the elephant in the room?

When people learn how to talk as a kid, it's easy. In fact &gt;93% of the people born learn to talk ""perfectly"". No seriously about [7%](https://www.asha.org/about/press-room/quick-facts/) of Americans have speech impairment (most being minor issues), the rest ""learned to speak"" as a child. just by *existing*. No kid was ever forced to learn to talk and we all do.

On the other hand, if you learn language merely a few years after your infancy... You will permanently have an accent your entire life. It's [practically impossible](https://academic.oup.com/applij/article/41/5/787/5530705) for a second language learner to master a language as well as a native speaker. Yes it can be done, but only the top 1% or so can speak a language such that no native speaker can tell the difference.

I was taught that in a lot of ways other skills are this way too. In fact, this was one the pillars of truth in life.

You cannot be a chess grandmaster if you don't start playing as a chess. This is a fact, I don't think there is even one case of that. In fact, I saw Hikaru Nakamura (one of the best chess players) saying you can't be FM, IM or GM if you start as an adult. Which means, if he's right, practically no human, even smartest ones, who started learning chess as an adult (i.e. &gt;=20s) can be a titled chess player. Let that sink in.

And the same thing applies to music. No one who start as an adult can be a professional musician. Maybe a third violinist in a local orchestra? But it's impossible for them to be a soloist or first violin and be paid.

So, I see this as a fact of life. I love playing chess, but I know that no one will ever pay me play chess. And that's ok. I also know no one will pay me play violin.

But it's a curiosity whether you can an adult starter can still master violin to a respectable level. Like imagine a little kid, say someone who has been playing a few years or so, trying to play Chaconne, or Paganini etc. You'd probably cringe and be like... you're 15 years away from that kiddo. Calm your goddamn tits.

Now, let's be realistic, can you *really* say this to an adult? Like is it even possible for someone to start playing violin in their adults and be able to play Chaconne or Paganini? Maybe a few people did in the entire common practice era?

Like seriously, since 1720 has there been a single person who started learning violin as an adult and *actually* performed Partita no 2 in a way that can be regarded ""passable""? We're talking about 300 years! How many people has there been do you think in the entire 300 years? 0? 1? 2?

I studied linguistics and sometimes teach my native language to foreigners. Some say they want to live in a country whose native language is this. As a teacher, I *always* make sure I set the expectations right. Yes you can learn this language, yes you can communicate with people in this language. But no it's impossible for you to be able to speak in a way a native speaker can't tell apart. You will never be able to write a literature book in this language and it'll be considered good. And of course everyone is ok with that.

But this sort of elephant in the room is never addressed when it comes to music.

I just thought I had to get this out and say.

It seems to me that if my open string (in tune, just tuned, etc.) sounds flat after a fingered note, then that fingered note is sharp. Conversely, if my open string sounds sharp, then my fingered note is probably flat (although that isn't something I'm noticing, right now. It's usually that the open string sounds flat).

Before I express my frustration and request advice, here is a brief list of my problems regarding tension.

\- Right shoulder- when practicing string crossings, after a few measures of open strings practice, I start feeling tense in my right arm. My teacher told me it was due to my right shoulder and recommended I constantly compare how the shoulder feels relaxed to my actual playing.

\-Left hand: apparently my left hand feels tense due to my thumb, so my teacher gave me a Schradieck exercise on one string where I focus on keeping my thumb relaxed, at some points playing without it making contact with the neck. Even if I am not playing while holding my hand at the neck, I start getting tense. So I've tried again the ""compare feeling relaxed to feeling tense"" method, to no avail.

\-Shifting. I can't seem to access the upper positions without feeling strain, no matter how I manipulate my elbow or my left thumb.

Since eliminating tension is the main goal of practicing fundamentals, I find myself cutting practicing each exercise early. It feels like an exercise in futility practicing string crossings or shifting if I can't even get rid of the tenseness associated with these things.

Now the purpose isn’t really to play them fast or up to tempo, but for now just to find the right pressure to make them sing and not feel crunched (+ intonation, hand frame and all that stuff).

,1618853521,mu5tp1,"I've played the violin for about 7 years. I've been a faithful practice for most of that time, though I'd consider my skill level to be average, if a little below that. As I've been preparing my repertoire for my senior recital (Bruch Violin Concerto, Bach Partita no 3, a few other various pieces), I've come to realize that I have truly begun to resent the instrument. 

For me, violin is a constant cycle of frustration, anxiety, and relief. At this point in time, especially with the pandemic, most of my friends have either quit or put away their instruments. I don't plan on continuing to play after I graduate from high school, though I have committed to myself to last at least until then. I'm never been a spontaneous quitter, and my parents have paid good money for continuous private lessons throughout high school and purchasing a better instrument for me than I probably deserve. 

Looking it back on it all, however, I've found I can never point to a time in my life where I've *enjoyed* playing the instrument. Orchestra with friends in school was fun, and I've certainly felt satisfaction at mastering a difficult technique or passage, but nothing I would define has happiness. I'm plagued with horrible performance anxiety, and these days my practice sessions are either spent in frustration or resigned determination. Practicing is a chore, and nothing more. Once I put my 45-60 minutes a day in, I put the thing away and hope not to see it until tomorrow. 

So why keep playing? For me, there's no ecstasy or bliss at finishing a performance or recital with that last, sweeping note. I would define what I feel afterwards as unhealthy relief. After a performance, I can *feel* the knots in my stomach relaxing and can revel for a few hours in the weight that's been taken off my chest. By far, the trade off is lopsided, cumulatively resulting more negative emotion than positive. 

I think expectation is the reason I've continued as long as I have. My parents, who've invested so much in me, and my violin teacher, who thinks I'm better than I am, always shower me with assurances and confidence in me whenever I hesitantly try to talk about my feelings. Quitting would break their hearts, and seeing that would end up breaking mine as well. So I plan to keep going, always motivated but never invigorated, until I finally leave for college and have an excuse to quietly tuck the violin away without raising too much concern. 

In many ways, I feel trapped. Do I deserve to be angry at being given an opportunity many others would envy? Is it my fault I'm in this situation, for not having the drive to hone my talents and practice until I end up banishing my doubts? It feels like I can only direct my emotions at my violin, which is unproductive and does nothing to improve my mood. 

I'm not looking for sympathy. I'm just curious if anyone else has had similar feelings, and if they were able to make peace with it. Thanks.",violinist,My Buried Resentment for the Violin,,1

20-year violin player here.  In my early 30s. Started when I was 8 years old, and played consistently until my Senior year of high school. Was in the honors program in school, and was part of the Tri-M society. In 2017 I decided to pick up my violin again after a decade and began playing for wedding ceremonies.

I'm looking to sound better for wedding ceremonies this summer and exploring electric violins.  The more I look into it, the more appealing it is for me to have an electric violin as I live in a condo and I would love to practice more at home. I have never owned an electric violin before. I ran into the Yamaha YEV 104/105 violins, and I have a couple of questions:

1. Should I get the 104 or 105? Which one and why/why not? I am tempted to go for the 105 because I would love to go lower and learn to play with the C string for some music. I love the depth and richness of the C string. However, I've never played with a 5 string before. I also struggle reading bass clef ( I can practice though).
2. What else do you recommend I purchase with the Yamaha YEV 104/105? I am expecting to buy a case, and maybe a new shoulder rest, but do I need a bow?

Teacher,1618591727,ms7a1s,"I was in high school when I first encountered the little piece of plastic that covers the silver winding of so many student bows. 

A friend of mine was getting ready for a performance, needed some help, and asked me for an impromptu lesson. I didn’t have my violin with me, but the two of us found a quiet place to work through the tricky bits of the piece. 

As she played, I noticed that her right index finger kept slipping. I asked to try her instrument. It took about half a second to notice what was causing the problem. I felt a piece of clear plastic covering the silver winding. 

Ironic since the winding is there to give the finger a point of friction. I took it off the bow and that problem was fixed!

Over the years I have noticed that a startling percentage of beginners have that piece of plastic on their bows. Many teachers don’t notice it because their professional bows never had it, and it's fairly inconspicuous. 

I’ve encountered a small number of people who insist that the plastic should be left there to protect the winding from getting tarnished. To me, this makes no sense for two reasons. 

Firstly, most luthiers will clean tarnished windings for free during a re-hair with a polishing cloth, it takes only a minute to do. Secondly as mentioned above the whole point of the winding is to create a point of friction. Plastic is not conducive to that...

,1618527104,mrq5m9,"So, I’ve had an issue the moment I picked up the violin. And here I am eight months later with the exact same issue: any time I finger a note the violin sounds nasally or choked. Had a luthier take a look at the instrument at the onset to make sure everything was setup properly.

Open strings are god damn gorgeous.

I’ve ran through everything I can think of. Was I applying pressure with my bow arm (for some reason) when I fingered a note? Nope. Exactly the same stroke was being used. When I was thinking about fingerings was my bow technique getting lax? Unfortunately enough, when I isolated just playing any fingered note the tone tanked compared to the open string. Tried slower bow speed, faster bow speed, and nothing. Tried so many different contact points as well. I’ve even tried changing pressure on the finger board — from barring down (nothing to scary) to delicately so that we avoid those pretty harmonics.

That’s what‘s even crazier! My harmonics sound lovely when I isolate them!

I do have a $300 student instrument, but I know from learning other instruments that blaming the instrument is bad praxis — because chances are it’s the student that’s at fault this early in the game!

The entirety of practicing has been done during lockdown/quarantine, so when I bring this up during my lesson my teacher doesn’t hear anything and thinks I sound fine. Maybe my microphone isn’t picking it up.

Or I am crazy.

But have you guys heard about, or dealt with, this issue before? It’s driving me nuts and I’m at a loss.

I try to practice every day, some weeks I don't make it, but there's never a week that goes by where I don't have a lesson and a practice (unless I am on vacation). I've been told I've graduated from beginner now and that my starter bow is pretty low quality and rehairing it may cost more than the bow is worth and she recommended that I get a new carbon fiber bow. I've been loving playing violin so it's worth the investment to me to upgrade. I knew when I bought my used starter violin that one day it and its bow would be replaced.

Teacher,1618451876,mr57q8,"Relatively new teacher here.

I've been having trouble I think with my younger students. I'm a bit removed from what it's like to be a young violinist, because I started at 16, and as a composition major, my focus was always on theory. This makes teaching my adult beginners incredibly easy. They arrive at a problem (for example, not being able to distinguish between high and low 2), I explain to them the fix (knowing when and why we do high or low 2), they go ""Oh that makes sense"" and the problem usually goes away instantly. Obviously, posture, grip, and some technique issues take time and lots of reminders, but I can usually see results instantly.

The opposite is true of my younger students, but in a weird way. They arrive at a mistake (a rhythm error), and I go over the fix (this one is long, this one is short, etc.), I finish explaining it, ask them if they understand, they say they do, so we go to play it and they immediately make the same mistake. Now that's fine by itself, I know that translating what you know into the sound that comes out is hard, so I explain it again and have them run the spot again, and get the same thing.

This cycle repeats for like 5 or 10 minutes until I can sense that the kid is starting to get tired of all the troubleshooting, so we move on, leaving the mistake in place.

Bad habits seem totally invincible, especially ones picked up from a bad source that the kid believes is good. I have one student (about 8 years old I think), and she loves bluegrass fiddle music, so she holds the violin with her wrist supinated, lets the violin drop off her shoulder during easy passages, and constantly taps her foot. I've explained to her many times why these are bad and why we need to stop, but like, one, she's picking all this up from watching bluegrass players, and two, she's 8, she's not old enough to logically comprehend why we need to stop these habits.

Obviously, logic and reason aren't going to get me anywhere, so I need to take a new approach.

I've found some slight success with gameifying things. Kids love video games, and kids love winning, so I can get some impressive results out of my younger students by turning simple things into games (my usual is to see how far they can get through a piece without the problem occurring). 

But obviously I can't do this with everything. I need a way to kind of sell the fix to the kid, convince them of how crucial it is. 

What should I do? I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels whenever I'm troubleshooting with my younger students.",violinist,Having trouble getting my younger students to implement fixes,,1

I want to tell my story with violin, because I feel like soon in might be over.

So I'm playing since 2005, with two years break in meantime. From the very beginning I had teachers that didn't care to teach me well, or they didn't know how to. I was also unlucky in that matter, as they changed almost every year for one or another reason.

Somehow I managed to stick with playing that long, but there were countless moments when I wanted to quit, smash the violin, start doing something else but - it came to the situation that I felt sad about loosing all this years of practice and dedication, so I again tried to continue. 

I moved to Russia, looking for teaching of great teachers that I heard about in Europe. I got into conservatory and I found out that most of technique I learned is wrong and I have to re-learn it. My teacher said that at this point it would actually be easier if I would start from the very beginning now.

At the same time teachers didn't really wanted to practise technique with me (I also had to change teachers here, due to some crazy shit, maybe I could write abot it if anyone would want to).

Now I'm about to graduate bachelor degree and I'm so disappointed. I feel like I learned more from Internet than from my current teacher. Lately she actually told me that she's not able to teach me more about my pieces and I have to deal with them myself till the end of the year.

I'm not sure if I'll graduate with no teaching. I'm very depressed about it, I wish to do music without such big problems.

Son is currently on a 1/4 violin. He's been at it for almost a year now. However, his bow has lost a few hairs now and then, and to my amateur ears it's starting to make a little bit more squeaky sounds. Now, that could be the kid is getting sloppy, or the bow is aging. Also, he dropped the bow a couple of times recently. This is the bow that came with the violin, which my understanding it's nothing special, so I think replacing the bow is the right move.

All that said, if I'm replacing his current bow, and given that in a year or so he will grow out of the 1/4 violin, should I go ahead and get him a 1/2?

Student,1617767266,mltjbp,"I'd imagine most intermediate or advanced players, myself included, have some of the same few pieces as goals: things like the Big Four concertos or the Chaconne. What are some less grand or less popular pieces you have as a goal? If you're a beginner and just want to get to Suzuki book 5, that counts. If you're an advanced player aiming to play La Ronde des Lutins or Erlkonig or something, that counts too.

I'll start with some of my goals. One of them is Sarasate's Malagueña. It's not my favorite of his Spanish Dances—that would probably be the Habanera featured in the Violin Jam—nor is it the most difficult. However, it's a goal (a shorter-term one) because it would help strengthen two techniques I'm bad at, namely harmonics and left hand pizz (and I'm not ready for Zapateado yet).

Another one of my goals is Paganini Caprice 6. I love how it sounds: it's probably my favorite of the 24. It's a bit out of reach now, but hopefully in a year or two I could learn it seriously and bring to performance standard.

The final goal piece I'd like to share is Ysaye Sonata 1. Like the Paganini, it's likely a bit out of reach for me now but I love it.

,1617617116,mkh6w5,"Hi /r/violinist!

I have come into a big problem.. I've always had somewhat sensitive ears - even with ear plugs on and going to a night club, I would have ear pain afterwords. I just figured my threshhold/sensitivity to noise is different than other people - but can't possibly be too unusual

However when playing the violin, I can't play without earplugs in for more than a few minutes before getting very bad ear pains. It hasn't always been like this - but seems to get gradually worse over time with consistent prolonged practice each day. Obviously to protect my hearing, I started playing with ear plugs. Over time, I found that even that became deafening - with my ears ringing and sounding muted after practice. So I would start adding a soft mute. Then that became the same. I try to practice my bowing technique for half an hour or so without the mutes on, but then switch to a heavy mute to protect my ears, but that became a problem too.

For some reason, even with ear plugs and a heavy mute, the violin would still sound piercingly loud. I started playing with those chunky hearing protection headphones (branded as 38db reduction in sound), with ear plugs in as well (20-25db reduction) AND a heavy rubber mute. And now over time (especially since doing more and more practice - around 4 hours per day average over the last couple of months, in blocks of 2+2 hours) it got to the point where my ears feel intense pain, feel worryingly muted and I think my tinitis is being made worse. So I've had to stop playing.

It's got to the point I'm scared I will have to quit the violin. I did a solo recording for orchestra last week and had to take off my violin mute for getting a good sound, and it felt so painful I would have to stop. It's like I was standing in a 120db hardcore rave for 6 hours, yet it was only a few minutes at a time playing my violin without a mute (with ear plugs and hearing protection headphones).

Does anyone know what this could be??? I have noticed that when I completely lift my jaw from the violin while playing, then it sounds as muted and muffled as you would expect it to with a heavy rubber mute and ear plugs. But when I put my jaw back to the violin, even softly (and with a folded pillow case for comfort) it sounds piercingly loud and I can hear every nuance of the bow and sound as if it has no mute on it and is blasting into my ears when playing. Does this mean that the reason it's so loud is because the sound is conducting through the instrument and through my jaw bones right to my ears, bypassing the hearing protection?? Does anyone know anything about this? It's just sad that it's now causing me pain even with so much hearing protection on.

Does anyone else get ear pain or hearing loss issues even playing with ear plugs?

It's got so bad to the point that my ears are now hyper sensitive to even moderate noises outside of playing the violin - if someone is talking too loud or if the TV is too loud, I now get the same ear pains and sensitivity and that stresses me out. I tried going to an audiologist since I was worried about making myself deaf from this - he said my hearing is perfect; however it could be a hearing disorder called Hyperacrusis (increased hearing sensitivity and pain due to prolonged repeated exposure to high levels of sound) but I need to find a specialist doctor to look into if this could be it. 

It's frustrating since I always wear hearing protection and now if I can't address this then I don't think I can have a career in music :| I already had to skip out on providing another recording to my amateur orchestra this weekend.",violinist,Ear pain even wearing ear plugs?

(1) Semi-pros and pros with decently-paid day jobs (like music educators) -- those that won't starve without gigs -- shouldn't be gigging right now because there aren't enough gigs to around, so they should be saved for those who depend on those gigs to pay their bills.

(2) Pros should never be playing for less than union wage, or wages for pros will be permanently depressed post-pandemic, especially with Management often taking the opportunity of the pandemic to renegotiate CBAs to the detriment of the musicians.

(3) Pros should not be playing anything for free for fun, if the concert isn't free, because people would otherwise be attending another concert that would benefit pros who are being paid. (And they certainly shouldn't play for ""exposure"", but that's always been the common wisdom.)

(4) Our local AFM, which normally turns a blind eye to AFM pros volunteering for fun or who are playing in freeway philharmonics that don't have a union CBA and wage, should start being more aggressive about enforcement. Even though this would likely kill numerous freeway philharmonics and some semi-pro orchestras, theoretically the money would then flow to bigger, healthier organizations.

(5) Pros shouldn't be giving lessons for free or reduced rates for charity, because some of those families might scrape up money for lessons if they were forced to (or someone else would sponsor them and pay the pros fully); therefore such lessons take bread out of the mouths of working musicians.

(6) Community orchestras shouldn't sell tickets, apply for grants, or take donations from non-members, because they are taking away from these things going to professional orchestras. (If members want to donate to keep the group afloat, that's just paying for their hobby and OK.)

For instance, I teach in a music program that provides free instruction to children living below the poverty line. Most of my fellow instructors are public-school music educators, and everyone else has some professional pedagogy training (like Suzuki or Kodaly or whatever). We're paid minimum wage for our time. This is different than a poverty-targeted program across town, which uses truly amateur volunteers (no professional music training beyond having received private lessons as children) and pays them nothing -- and is now killing that approach and replacing it with fully-paid (normal-lesson-fee, sponsored by donations) pro instructors for the reasons cited above.

And personally, as an AFM member, I still play in a community orchestra,  play in a semi-pro orchestra that doesn't pay its members, volunteer for charity gigs, and occasionally gig with freeway philharmonics that don't pay a union wage -- even though strictly speaking none of these things are allowed. I can afford to do it because I have a well-paid ""day job"".

Student,1617299055,mi0pqe,"Hi everybody!

I've been playing the violin for two years but sadly, due to the ongoing pandemi,c I haven't had any lesson since August and I can't ask my teacher about this.

I have an extremely unnerving issue with my bow: it's shaky. Now I remember when I began my bow was shaky because my hand was stiff and not relaxed, or because I was gripping the bow too hard, but I got better with time and I try to relax my hand as much as possible, so I'm not sure if this is the sole explanation. It's shaky only on downbows, from slightly before the middle to the tip. I'm not sure if shaky is the right word, I can see the wood woobling a lot, and the sound is not continuous, like it gets interrupted a few times per seconds. But I don't see the hair leaving the string. It's incredibly annoying, and nothing I have tried improved the issue.

Could it be an issue with the bow itself? (I usually wouldn't blame the instrument because I know how bad I am, but...) I noticed today it is slightly warped, with the tip going slightly to the right, seen from above.

I've tried various hair tensions, bow tilt, and using more/less rosin.

I have another issue: I press the fingerboard way too much with my left hand, and I'm not sure how to improve that. When I try to lighten my fingers, I get a weird sound, a bit like if the string was vibrating somewhere between two modes. Pressing more ""breaks"" the sound, making it nice and clean, and then I can release the pressure and sustain the note. But the first action needs to be very strong, almost painful. 

Any idea what could be wrong? I guess I must be stopping the string incorrectl. I try to drop my fingers on the string from the base joint, but I must be missing something. 

I realize those issues are common and hard to assess without seeing me playing, but maybe one of you could recommend an exercice or something to improve those points?

Thank you so much :)",violinist,Pressing hard on the fingerboard and shaky bow,,1

Ive been noticing, and my teacher too, that when i play my left hand gets really tense and i cant make it not be tense. I just played the wienawski violin concerto 2 and the bach e major partita (the whole thing) and thats around the point when i noticed it getting really tense. She told me to just relax my hand and pay a lot of attention to it. I think it was because i started to speed it up when i wasnt that confident in my sound and ability to play it? But now its gotten a lot worse, i thought it was tendonitis because ive gotten it twice before, but its not like that feeling. Im playing the Bruch g minor concerto and the bach g minor sonata, and ive been playing both VERY under tempo so that when i increase the tempo it wont be as tense, but i still notice it :(. My pinky kind of sticks up when i play and i know thats not great because it should b hovering over the fingerboard and ive honestly never had any issues with it before but im trying to fix it now because i know when i get to super notey sections thats just gonna be a pain to deal with.

I hate it, buzzing on the G string sometimes to the point of popping off, all the notes sounding weird.

First, it feels EXACTLY like my other violin.  It doesnt make my bowing sound different or better. I expected it to hide my mistakes.  Perhaps for projection, sure.  Ill make sure to continue playing the acoustic at least 20 mins a day.  Also still using the same bow and shoulder rest

Third, it is SOOOO much nicer than the muted strings to play, just like my regular violin.  Not the extra flat and buzzing sounds i was growing to hate.   Yes it does have that similar muted sound with headphones off.. and it is even quieter than the mute.  I can play a tune at midnight when i wake to get a drink. Its like a tv on low.

It's not that I don't think I'm making progress, but of late I've began feel as though I'm hitting a wall with my practicing - like I'm going through the motions but not being effective.  When I expressed this concern to my teacher he said it could likely be due to the jump in difficulty at the end of Suzuki 2.

Teacher,1615906292,m6asw3,"Here is my confession, I like contemporary music. Not everyone can say the same I know. My first performance of a 21st-century piece caused one member of the audience to gasp at the abrupt downward glissando in the opening statement. 

I listened to the echoing sound of my major 3rd glissando, combined with the panic of a woman who thought I had just lost my mind resonate through the church...glorious.    

Now let me be perfectly clear, not all contemporary music is good, I would even go so far as to say that most of it is very bad and will be lost to the passage of time. But isn’t that true of every time period?

Surely there were bad composers in the time of Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms that are now forgotten!

I would never insist that you have to like all contemporary music, that would be ridiculous. However, I find distaste in the notion that is so often presented that “all New Music is bad”. 

To those who claim to hate new music, my first question is always “well which pieces/composers have you listened to?” Most often that list is very limited or only has student composers on it. (and no, Schoenberg doesn’t count as new music...he’s been dead for 70 years)

There is a notion that ""people don’t like new music"" and so many of us are happy to jump on the bandwagon. Ironically this same notion draws many of the general public away from the classics that we love.  

How many of you have had a conversation with a non-musician, who insisted that they don’t like classical music because it’s boring. Meanwhile, the performance they had ever heard was from their 8-year-old nephew's recorder class. 

I imagine you wanted to wring their neck and tell them that classical music is more than just something to help you doze off. I wonder what these people would think of, the Berlin Philharmonic performing Shostakovich 5 or Beethoven 7 or many of the works you surely hold dear.

There always seemed to be too much tension somewhere, if not in one body part then in the other, and even though I felt like I was focusing on the task at hand, I never seemed to be able to play even a simple scale in tune, let alone anything more involved. 

That frustrated me immensely, because I have a hard time enjoying myself if I'm not playing in tune, even if the overall sound is good, and it just bred a cycle of frustration at lack of intonation =&gt; more stress =&gt; more tension =&gt; worse playing =&gt; more frustration. 

It's as if my brain was cognizant enough to recognize and be annoyed at my intonation issues, yet couldn't focus enough to muster the right pitches and hear that special brilliance notes seem to have when they're in tune. 

I'm happy to say that the big rush is over for now, and I had a great practice today where everything went right and I felt like I could sing through my instrument again, as if nothing had happened, which was a relief. 

Music is usually my escape. To have stress come in the way of my most therapeutic hobby was unwelcome, to say the least, so I would like to reduce the occurrence of such situations in the future. A couple of bad practices is understandable, but not two weeks straight.

Student,1615741089,m4yww0,"Hi! I'm a current high school senior and I'm looking into what college will entail in terms of violin playing. I know I will not pursue a degree in performance (my intended major is chemistry), but I do want to join an orchestra or chamber ensemble and I have looked a bit into music programs for non-majors at the schools I've applied to. I enjoy the instrument and I know I still have much to learn.

I have a couple worries, mostly relating to time for practicing and for balancing music with studies. I would say I am currently a late-intermediate player: I can play most of the solo Bach movements but am rather far from the fugues and the Chaconne. I haven't done many showpieces or any non-Baroque concertos, so a lot of my long-term goals are related to expanding my non-Baroque repertoire and to develop Romantic-era technique.

Based on my level, how feasible do you think it would be for me to continue learning violin on my own in college and beyond? Obviously it's always better to have a teacher, but I'm worried I won't have time or money for lessons in college. I'm not really looking to perform solos or anything; I just want to expand my repertoire and technique.

Teacher,1615661812,m4cpsq,"I want to start by saying that I understand that for people who live in apartments, townhouses, etc. the practice mute is a necessity. If that describes your situation then you may disregard the rest of this.

If, however, you can practice without one and you choose to do so then you are my target audience! 

“But why?” you ask, could such a small, innocuous piece of rubber be causing this violin teacher such frustration and grief? Let me explain dear Reddit reader.

Over the years I have encountered many students with what I would call an “unhealthy reliance” on their mute. This spans all age groups and levels from the very beginner to university level violinists who will refuse to perform, rehearse, or even practice without a mute on.

The reason mutes are so appealing is because they hide problems in our playing, but overuse of a mute can hinder tone and intonation. 

The mute dampens the resonance of the instrument, because of this, weight and sounding point become more forgiving. You can dig into the string and it will not sound as offensive as it normally would. Prolonged practice this way will build bad habits and the longer one practices with a mute the worse it will sound once you take it off. 

The intonation problem is more subtle but equally important. Intervals that are played in-tune will resonate or “ring”. With a mute, this phenomenon is also dampened making it harder to differentiate between in-tune and out-of-tune notes.   

In my personal practice, I rarely use a mute. Even in pieces where a mute is indicated I will first practice it without one to make sure I am getting the tone and pitch right. 

There is another element that is more phycological but is worth mentioning. Students that refuse to take the mute off often have a fear of people (sometimes even themselves) hearing them make a mistake. 

I empathize with these students’ fears, but to quote Mimi Zweig “mistakes are neither good nor bad, they’re simply information”. It is what you do with that information that is good or bad and practicing with a mute is hiding from the problems in your playing not confronting them head-on.

So please take the mute off and lock it away. I promise that you will not regret it.",violinist,PSA – Please Stop Practising with a Mute!,Setup/Equipment,1

There is one specific moment where the note goes so high it feels as if it could break, but it holds out. It used to be one of my absolutely favorite pieces and It’s escaped my memory. 
If it helps, I think that Gil Shaham did the piece and it was my favorite version....

,1615653337,m49t7c,"Every summer, I coach chamber music for a diverse population of kids, many of them students at high-poverty public schools who learned to play through the string orchestra program and have never had private lessons. I work with some of those kids one-on-one for brief pull-outs from the main sessions. I also volunteer in the public school string orchestra program, coaching orchestral music and sometimes briefly working with individual kids in pull-outs for technical issues.

I've wanted to do more volunteer teaching with populations that can't usually afford lessons, and to do it online during this pandemic. I've been considering the possibility of trying to start a program focused on older players -- maybe older teens living in households where parents won't pay for private lessons, or low-income adults, or even seniors -- together with other people willing to volunteer teaching time. Program structures for disadvantaged students are usually primarily focused on younger children -- probably because of the belief that violinists should start young.

In particular,

Right hand: Thumb to the middle of the leather pad ( I used to be between the pad and the frog ) and perpendicular ( in cross ) with the bow hair. It seems to allow more finger flexibility, but also makes the bow feel a bit more unstable. 

Left hand: Thumb under the fingerboard underneath the middle finger, 2nd finger. ( I used to have it much closer to the index finger, 1st finger.) and most importantly, when changing positions she is asking me to ""lead"" with the thumb for the positions and to move the thumb before the fingers on the downshift. I was thought to always move lla the fingers together as a package.

Let me explain. Some teachers in the past tell me, ""Oh, you know how to practice!"" And to that, I would say, ""Yes, I do know to practice, if by practice you mean how the average violinist practices."" And what occurs in ""average practice"" are mistakes that keep coming back without being ironed out completely, which translates to embarrassing flubs in performance.   

While on that vein, I watched a video that said, ""Your performance of a piece is the average of the last one hundred times you've played it."" What I gather from this statement is that if I make mistakes while practicing (which is supposedly encouraged in many disciplines so we can learn from them,) I am harming my ""average,"" so to speak.  

And this is what scares me. If I put in an hour of practice, trying to iron out a mistake while having a considerable amount of mistakes made, I have basically contributed towards a lower average of accuracy.

As a composition student, I'd love to get into more modern works for violin, but I don't really know where to start.

I don’t have a tutor, and the audition requirements aren’t released until the first week on campus this fall. I’d like to have someone to at least help me learn some nice solos and improve my technique, but don’t know if the money is worth it (more so doable) given my financial circumstances. I’m debating if it’s better to learn the solos on my own and just do enough to get into the university orchestra, then take lessons at college when I become more financially independent and could possible receive them for free... 

I started playing the violin in the school orchestra my fifth grade year and joined a youth orchestra in high school, but never had a tutor growing up; the only times I did was on a handful of occasions during high school to help with regional and youth orchestra audition material, most being provided by the school. My youth orchestra peers have competed at many competitions and always have multiple concertos they could pull out on demand, and it makes me doubt my violin journey.

My parents don’t know much about the music world or the fact that tutors were a norm until a couple years ago, but even then, it was always out of their budget.

I'm getting a kind of buzz/tinnitus in my left ear. Everything started after I had some dental work done in the molar or rather, had my treatment delayed for about three weeks between covid and waiting for the prosthesis to arrive. Then the buzz started started. I finished the treatment, waited some weeks, nothing happened, still had the buzz, went back to the dentist and we ran through everything we could and I really believe she's done everything she could, she says it is fine on her end.

Meanwhile, I went to two otolaryngologists, they couldn't find anything wrong, I ran the audiometry tests without any noticeable hearing loss. Even though, my buzz in the left ear still persists, it is more noticeable when I lie down to sleep and after I play the violin, it SEEMS it gets louder, though I'm not really sure if it's only my perception at the time. I feel my left ear is more ""delicate"" and it gets uncomfortable a lot easier with loud sounds. Both otolaryngologists mentioned it could be some kind of TMJ disorder, I want to know if anyone has went through this and have some kind of advice, I'm trying to find a TMJ specialist but things are about to get expensive, I'd love to hear some input from someone, even if it's happened to someone in their school/college.

Everything I find online when I look this up is some very inconclusive academic papers that barely include this as a factor, no forum posts. Usually tinnitus and buzzing are related with playing very loud violins for a long period of time. I'm quite sure this is not the case, because I always use either an artino mute or ear plugs and as a beginner I rarely go beyond two hours of playing/practice.

My violin teacher doesn't seem to find that I do anything wrong in my posture, I've tried different chin rests and shoulder rests meanwhile, the problem is that I'm 1.94cm (6""4' in imperial) with a long neck, so trying to find the correct setup is a bit hard to me, my teacher specializes in children so I think my anatomy is a bit out of what she sees everyday. I'm current using a bonmusica with a 50mm feet on the top and a 50mm on the bottom and a chinrest that looks like a dresden with three 2mm cork on the bottom I've tried central chinrests and guarneris, seems to fit better.

I am a uni student in the US who will be going abroad this fall to study in Singapore for 4 months (COVID permitting). While I’m there, I obviously want to practice. I don’t fly often so I’m unfamiliar with how traveling with a violin works, I would feel more comfortable bringing it as a carry-on if possible. However, I’m worried about how my violin will hold up during the long flight and change in climates - I am flying out of the East Coast, so it’s pretty much on the other side of the world haha. I was thinking about possibly borrowing a violin in SG for 4 months, since I may get some scholarship money that can cover a rental. At the same time, I’m concerned about how playing with a new violin would impact my technique upon returning home to my personal violin, and having it sitting at home untouched for 4 months doesn’t seem like a great idea either...

My questions are: Should I bring my personal violin, or should I rent in SG? What are your experiences with flying with your violin? Any airline recs? Alternatively, (very specific question for Singaporeans) where would I be able to rent a violin?

I currently don’t plan on performing there (unless I am able to get into the uni orchestra somehow), for now I’d just like to practice.

A couple of weeks ago my instrument (~200$, default strings) went out of tune so I started messing with pegs and broke the string. I changed all strings and got rid of the old ones. The new ones I got are Dogal Green Tag (less than 20$). I got them because I was told in the store that they are cheap but would make a good sound.

Since then (it's been around 2 weeks) my tone quality is terrible (maybe apart from the E string). I blame the strings but maybe am wrong about it. The sound is scratchy, dry. It's the worst when I play in 3rd position. It sometimes ceases when I rosin my bow like crazy, then the sound goes back to terrible after a minute or so of playing. What I noticed is that the strings are really soft compared to the old ones. And the G string in vibrates too much. It feels like it's too loose, but it's tuned well. When I play open G it sounds like double bass.

Will this get better? Should I wait and hope for them to sound better? Or maybe I'll adjust with time? I'm at a point when I'm ready to buy new ones.

My first teacher played really well but had zero teaching experience, and as a result, could not point out key mistakes in my technique and posture. When I started practising alone in front of the mirror I could see some glaring mistakes, things I observed from watching youtube videos (Eddy!). Since he never pointed these things out for more than a year, I lost confidence and quit. 

Then due to Covid, I started virtual lessons. Did not go well. The teacher could hardly see my full posture and could not give me a lot of specific technical advice. Simply saying relax your shoulders can only go so far. There were some more experiences with teachers in between.

I keep a practice log and I usually warm up with 5 minutes of open strings, 15 mins of scales, 10 mins of bowing exercises, 15 mins of left hand exercises, then spend the last 15 mins working on a piece-- you know, if my goal is trying to bring up the tempo of a piece then that'll be what I'm doing for 15 mins.

,1623681716,nzocca,"I'm a good month into learning the cello and notice I struggle with getting all my fingers on the board. 

For example hitting the G on the D string. I have to stretch my pinky. My teacher told me that wasn't good so she said I had to search for a comfortable grip that allows me to put all my fingers without stretching them. This usually works for the first three but if I have to put the pinky in there as well, that doesn't seem to work. 

At the moment I tend to slide my hand down a little to be able to hit the G better but then when I have to play G-F-E, I slide my hand back up in order to play the F and E. 

I tried position my thumb in a different position. I believe the best position is at the same height as the second finger?

Anyway, I dropped out of my bachelor of performance degree back in college, and now, years later, I would like to make a smaller, but still performance-oriented goal for myself, and this seems to fit the bill.  I learned that the ABRSM exams are open to all ages (great!), are available in the USA, and that you have to pass the theory level 5 before going to higher levels.  Agreed?  

Here are my questions....

1. do the syllabus piece-lists stay the same year-to-year?  In other words, if I begin learning a piece and it takes me more than a year to want to go to exam with it, is there a risk the piece will have fallen off the list?
2. what's the difference between ""practical"" exams and ""performance"" exams?  I just don't get it.
3. Is there a website where you can brush up the theory online?  Are there special ABRSM books you can buy?
4. If you pass the level 8 exam, is there a higher level you can go to after that?

We were all really nervous and messed up one piece pretty badly in a really, really obvious and public way! The first violin  (our most experienced player) was keeping an eye on the flow of the event so we would know when to stop to make way for some speeches... but in doing so she completely lost her place in the music... and then the rest of us got lost, too, and we all just sort of... stopped. That one was pretty painful for about 90 seconds. But the audience was still supportive, and we played some some other pieces really well.

1) Get comfortable playing in random, strange chairs. You never know what the venue will provide.

,1623067109,nuamp9,"Following this topic that I made https://www.reddit.com/r/Cello/comments/gv3axd/wobbly_endpin/

I decided to change the entier endpin system because in addition to the wobbling from low quality CF shaft, the screw just wasn't working anymore, the whole thing was very bad quality imo.

So I asked to have a steel endpin, just a regular classical endpin that work well and is reliable. I ended with a Weidler steel endpin which work very well, no wobbling, great stability BUT ! Something has changed, in a positive manner !

The cello has always been hard to play, bad response time, I have to work very hard on the bow to make it speak and I never can rely on the instrument, very frustrating, with some strange sound effect on double strings (wolf-like on double stopped harmonics, weird...). 

All of this was solved by the new steel endpin ! I'm just blown away, I never imagined that the CF endpin was the problem for the bad response of the cello. Of course, good CF engine work well, so I'm guessing my CF endpin was really really bad... 

What is your guess about that ? The old CF endpin was absorbing too much from the cello, dampening it ? Also, the luthier had to drill a larger hole for the new endpin system, maybe this as some effect ?

PS: every other things are well set because in my attempt to solve the response problems I had made 2 setup by 2 different luthier to see the effect, so bridge and soundpoast are well set.",Cello,Endpin change - response and resonance,,0

The only problem is, I recently discovered that one of the guys I like to watch has a cello that was priced at $*32,000*... And his bow wasn't cheap either... 

If you're getting frustrated or discouraged with a cello that costs what us normal people can afford, just remember that your favorite cellists are playing on cellos that cost more than most people's vehicles. I have my own reservations about the sheer absurdity of rising instrument prices in an era where cost should be going *down* dramatically, but I digress.

Price doesn't automatically translate to good sound (I've heard some pretty bad expensive violins/cellos before), but *usually* it's a matter of better materials and craftsmanship. Usually.

,1622903933,nsx59j,"Hi! I help my son with cello stuff. Time flies, and he has had the same set of strings for 2 years! At a summer mini-camp, an instructor gave some indiv feedback, including that his A string could be brighter. Current strings are Kaplan daddario medium. This cello is a wide-body, so it does favor the lower tones. The Kaplan strings are fine, except I am wondering if a different A, to be brighter, would help. Such as Pirazzi Gold. Or, might he merely need new strings.

Also, he does find playing on the high end of the A string to be challenging. It seems like getting a light versus medium gauge string would help. But then, that is moving to weaker sound versus stronger.

But if he had a great, pricey A string, that might overcome the relative weakness of a light gauge string. Is he more at risk of A string breaking if he gets a high quality light gauge string?

I guess I am hoping that spending more money will solve all problems: risk of string breaking, strong bright lead tone, and ease of playing high on the fingerboard. Will money solve all problems? Or at least this one?

Basically, it's a series of fast, strummed, pizzicato triple stops that could in theory be played by a single cello (by an ultra-virtuoso), but I've split them into 2 parts to make it simpler. I took the this idea from Debussy's Ibéria.

I have 2 questions because it's not completely like Debussy's example:

1. Even if simplified, each player still needs to change back-and-forth between 2 chords. This chord voicing (root, 5th ,10th) requires barring all the strings with the index finger, would making this so many times become too tiring?

2. In theory pizzicati not involving open strings decay very fast (people say l.v. ties in this case are meaningless), but even considering this, would 1 cello playing a chord and the other playing the next one cause excessive blurring? Think of it as in not lifting the piano's damper pedal.

Student,1622314974,nnu1zl,"Hello everyone.

Today while I was practicing, the thought of upgrading from my student cello struck me. This has never happened to me, since my student cello is of a pretty decent quality (it costs 1.200 euro and it is a  rented instrument, just for the record).

I have been studying for a little over a year and a half, practicing diligently every day. I am very driven, and I have the best teacher ever, so I have been seeing a bit of progress in my technique. I am aware of the fact that technique and practicing is everything, and that you should not focusing on getting a better instrument because at the beginning, you would see little difference in upgrading to a better cello. 

My thoughts on upgrading started a couple months ago, but today while practicing these thoughts became more clear, as I have pieces that I have been perfecting for months, and I have started to notice that my sound differs just ever so slightly from the sound of my recording in some parts. I remember that, when I first went to my local luthier to get my first cello ever, the one I have right now, i could barely notice any difference on the sound of the instruments I got to choose from, so I chose mine because I liked the colour of the wood (please don’t judge me).

It is also worth mentioning that I am super attached to my rental cello, she has been with me since the beginning of this wonderful adventure and therefore she has emotional value. I doubt I can ever get rid of her. Do you also have special attachments to your instruments or am I just crazy?

In brief; Of course, I don’t have the need of going out and buying a super expensive instrument right now, I am more interested in hearing your experiences about this; what was the thing that made you realise you needed an upgrade? I am genuinely interested in how this happened for other people, since it feels like it’s a bit of a rite of passage for me. What an interesting feeling!

,1622247170,nnb9sm,"I'm an adult learner, at the early intermediate stage. I've been wanting to experiment with different types of strings, but of course that's an expensive proposition!

I like its responsiveness-- it activates with a very light touch, and it's my understanding that's one of the primary characteristics of Evah Pirazzi strings. But at this point I don't know whether I should should purchase D, G, and/or C strings, as well. 

Does anyone here use Evah Pirazzi strings? If so, do you use a full set? Just A and D? What do you like/dislike about them?

I want to try to learn the cello next, I primarly want to just do covers of songs that I find beautiful, which is a lot of contemporary stuff. I have a couple of questions for anyone who would be so kind to answer:

How do you practice Cello for those that live in an apartment?

Would the electric cello be worth it to practice, or should I just get acoustic and go to a space to practice? 

What price range should I be looking to spend?

Finger span is another issue, for example playing C, D, E with 1,2,4 as finger numbers respectively, has been a challenge for me to learn and do it in correct intonation, even now and then I cannot do it.

,1621066590,nctvt5,"Hello,

I just upgraded my bow for the first time ('Alfred Knoll 304C', Pernambuco, CA$800), and need advice on if I should keep it or return it.

I was upgrading to eventually play more advanced pieces (Schumann, Elgar, etc.)--the new bow is very responsive &amp; light, and makes string crossings much easier. However, I find it's also hard to really ""dig"" into the strings with it. This causes my cello to project less, and makes it tough to play varied dynamics/sforzandos/spiccatos. 

There is also a weird vibration below my right index/middle fingers sometimes as I am playing--briefly feels like the bow will come apart between the wire coils and the leather grip. The bow also needs to be screwed almost completely to be tightened enough (i.e. stick not touching the hair).

I really like the tone the bow produces (richer and clearer notes), so I want to make this bow work. But I am not sure if the issues I am experiencing are beyond the normal new-bow-adjustment pains. Could someone please suggest what I should do?

Thank you in advance!",Cello,New Bow Help,,0
,1621059272,ncs7cp,"Hello! This is my first time buying a new bow, and I would really appreciate any piece of wisdom you could spare me!

I got a new $800 (CND) Pernambuco bow yesterday. My goal was finding a bow which would allow me to play more advanced repertoire (Elgar and Schumann Concertos, etc.).

The new bow feels extremely responsive and light. It's more tip-heavy than my old bow, and I can play string crossings with it much more smoothly. It also really enhances the tone of the cello--makes all the notes sound more ""focused"" (albeit a bit too bright). In the music store, it also produced really beautiful legatos, which made playing the Swan lake and other slow melodies an absolute pleasure.

But when I tried the bow again at home, I realized the legatos don't ""sing"" as much. Also, the balance of the bow is completely different from my old bow, and I am having difficulty ""digging"" into the strings. This causes my cello to project less, and the dynamics/sforzandos/spiccatos of my playing are really suffering. My body must have done something to try to compensate for it, because my right shoulder started hurting after playing with the new bow for about 1.5 hours. 

Also, I think there may be structural problems with the new bow-- I need to turn the screw almost the entire way to tighten the bow enough, and sometimes I feel a weird vibration from where the coil meets the leather grip on the bow. (My old bow never had these problems(?) so I don't know if these are normal or not.)

I really like the tonal quality the bow produces, and want to make it work; but it's really disheartening to hear my playing sound so boring all of sudden. I was wondering if someone could please tell me if it's:

1) normal to have such a tough adjustment period after buying a new bow? (Especially when going from a cheap student bow to a better bow)

2) normal for bows to have the above-mentioned structural quirks?

,1621013994,nceclf,"Our next meetup will be **this Saturday, again at 8 PM Scottish time (BST).** For those that haven't joined before: **Our meetups are supposed to be fun and super-casual.** Those that want to play and share some of the music they are currently working on, are welcome to do so. Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

Adult beginning cellist here with some troubles regarding technique, so my teachers advice has given me thankfully now healed tendonitis, by keeping my 4 fingers uncomforrably spread wide to be in tune all the time during every key/position on all four fingers. It took around 1 month to heal my arm and the pain was SEVERE.
During that time I have began watching slowed down videos of cellists analysing professional technique, and I see them quite often very subtly slide up or down a bit on the fingerboard to reach notes especially when going from fourth to the lower second finger, I also notice when people go from the first to the third finger their second finger stays very close to the third and is in no way perfectly in tune when so close to the third finger.

I have for now taken a break from this teacher due to this conflict,  as I have had trouble going from the fourth to second lower finger for ages despite stretching finger exercises. There is a lot more flexibility between my fingers yes but not in the way that all my 4 fingers are perfectly in tune in all keys. With a f or c sharp the second finger is always too low, and with flats it is vice versa.
I have resolved this issue now simply by sliding the hand just a bit up, and am now perfectly in tune all the time playing like this.
However my teacher keeps insisting it is necessary to have the finger spaced perfectly all the time in tune no matter what. But I find this impossible , and as far as I can tell on YouTube from other cellist nobody is actually doing that, and lots of subtle up and down movements happen to reach a note in tune. 


I am conflicted now and thinking of switching teachers, but I wonder now what the general outlook on this is.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey r/cello!

For background, I'm a violinist who learned the double bass (mostly) by myself. The next step in my mind was to teach myself the cello, so I went ahead and bought [this](https://www.musicarts.com/cremona-sc-500-premier-artist-cello-outfit-main0379919#!#full-description) cello off the Music &amp; Arts website for $1000 back in 2020 (huge mistake, as you can probably guess lol.)

I get the cello and sound... well, bad. Even open strings sound scratchy, especially the D string. I played around with a few of my friends' cellos and sounded decent, which I think ruled out my playing as the issue. I made sure my bow was properly rosined and even tried on a set of nicer strings, but the sound was still all scratchy. 

... Then I realize that my cello doesn't even have a sound post, and a crack is starting to form out of one of the F-holes because the front face of the cello is caving (this was already months into the purchase, so returning wasn't an option). I take it to a luthier and as soon as he lays eyes on it, he tells me I have a shitty cello that's worth $200, tops (I'm inclined to believe him because he made my violin and has my violin coach's recommendation\*). He also said he could install the sound post and fix the crack for $60 or completely revamp the cello for \~$800, but in the moment I decided I didn't want to sink any more money into a shitty instrument.

So now I'm stuck with an overpriced, damaged cello I don't really want. And I apologize if this came off like a rant LOL. My question is... could the lack of a sound post be the cause of the scratchiness, or is it more likely just the cello itself? If it's the latter I'll probably try my hand at consigning or selling it.

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/vic1hjk8k8jl1na/Song%20Without%20Words%20Cello%20Part.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vic1hjk8k8jl1na/Song%20Without%20Words%20Cello%20Part.pdf?dl=0)

To explain, I've been focussing a lot recently on tonalisation and using the overtones/harmonics on each string to help them ensure good intonation. Basically I work with my students to let the cello help them play in tune. This piece is centred around A minor / C major, with plenty of notes that will draw extra resonance out of the cello when they are perfectly in tune. 

Added to that, the double stopped section can be used to work further on listening and adjusting intonation. 

There is a lot of shifting, mostly playing in blocks, targeting good use of positions. We have plenty of extended position as well as closed position.  

It's in 3/4 time. There's also an opportunity to work on the bowing arm for good expressive technique, string crossings and the chance to work on a gentle hook stroke (ternary) in places. 

Please let me know what you think of it. It will be published with piano accompaniment, guitar chords (all my cello pieces are intended to be played with a band, even my sonatas), and a trainer that breaks up the sections to help learn them, highlighting the various techniques we are working on. Hopefully you like it as much as I do. Most of my music starts as songs I've written but this one started with twiddling on the piano, and try as I might, I've not yet been able to work out any lyrics.",Cello,New piece to share,,0

,1620749853,na0qt4,"Hey cellists!

Took a bit of a break from volunteer lessons while I finished up my finals, but we're back at it!

I’m an undergraduate Performance major looking to get more volunteer teaching experience. I noticed that a lot of people on the sub are having trouble finding private teachers (especially ones that they can afford because professionals are very expensive). At the same time, my studio has a few spots open. So, for the next four weeks, I wanted to offer some free half-hour Zoom lessons to any interested cellists at the beginner or intermediate level.

What we work on in those few weeks is entirely up to your needs—we can do solo repertoire, scales, orchestra music, or whatever you would find it most helpful to work on/have an introduction to. (Even if you wanna just ask a few personalized technical questions, I’d be happy to assist!) In the absence of any prepared repertoire, I can recommend some things befitting your level of experience.

I won’t put my full bio here, but I’ve been teaching for three years (one of those years fully online). As a student myself, I went to All-State Orchestra, graduated from some fairly renowned summer institutes, was principal in all my youth orchestras, and got a fellowship at my current university. (I’m a serious student cellist who’s also very serious about teaching! Just hoping I can be of service to the general cello-ing community. And, of course, it's nice getting volunteer hours while meeting other cool musicians.)

If you’re interested or want to know more about me, feel free to send a DM! In terms of scheduling, I'll give priority to those who can do weekdays (at any time), since that's when the bulk of my free time is right now. Looking forward to hearing from you!",Cello,Free lessons from performance undergrad for the next four weeks!,,0

This is a summary of my full article, which I'll put below shortly. I hope all this is helpful. 

As cellists we can spend a lot of money trying to find the best string solutions for our specific needs. I had sort of bypassed Jargar (except for Jargar Superior, which I really do like!) in the last several years because I had been finding too many cellos where the Jargar Medium set just didn't do the best job. In my research for our blogpost, I found out a stack of information I'd not previously considered: In their standard range, Jargar makes a whole variety of options that you can mix and match if needed, to get that required balance on your cello for a much more reasonable price.

I think that, while one should strive to achieve the technical ability to finger and bow as one is told if and when circumstances are such that one is told how to finger and bow and has to finger and bow accordingly, one should be ultimately be free in one's spare time to finger and bow as one best pleases (6 ones, that's 6 people, what we could play with 6 people, ahh).

Alternatively, in english, while I'm happy to provide my fingerings and bowing should anyone require them, I did not mark any such directions in the score.

I was wondering if anyone has found they had to switch from a 4/4 to 7/8 cello due to hand size and strain.

I’m aware that there will always be a slight disadvantage with sound quality, though I’m mostly playing for myself so this isn’t a huge concern. I’m more interested if it will have any advantage for more advanced techniques down the road and prevent injury in the coming decades. 

Very soon I’ll try to rent an Eastman 7/8 student cello and depending how things are going in a few months I’ll invest in a better quality instrument.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

I am a life long musician; I am a  classically trained singer and instrumentalist on several wind and brass instruments but have no experience or knowledge of string instruments except guitar.  I recently decided to learn the cello and have fallen in love with the instrument but cannot seem to get passed constant unwanted harmonics on all strings when trying to play or practise.  I know about finger pressure being a factor (I have studied Classical Guitar on a Basic level) but this is not the problem as I have the same issue on open strings.  I have watched tons of videos about hand, elbow, and bow position and doubt I am doing anything seriously wrong, albeit I am a total beginner.  Two online teachers and one live instructor found no major issues with my bow hold but failed to give me any real reason why this should be such a problem.

,1620069371,n44p1j,"I'm an adult (38 years old) willing to learn to play the cello. I always found the cello an amazing instrument but actually never thought about learning to play it... 

I've been playing the piano for a few years now and there are many pieces I play that are accompanied by the cello and the cello bits always give me goosebumps, not the piano parts :)   
I also got hooked by the cello from some scenes in Airwolf which is a childhood favorite series about a high tech helicopter :) 

Anyway, I'm planning on starting with a teacher in September in my local music school where I currently follow piano and composition. I will stop with piano in favor of the cello. 

I have a good job so money isn't really an issue. I checked online and I think the budget I can use for a cello is up to 2000 euro.  I'm from Belgium so if some of you could provide some advise on where or what to buy in that price range, that would be awesome.   
I know many people start with renting one but because I feel so strongly about the cello for so long, I don't think I will not like it :) Also because I have experience with both piano and guitar, I believe I have sufficient musical background to understand what I will put myself into. 

Because the lessons will start in September (start of new school year), I am wondering if I best wait to buy a cello in August and don't touch it until my lessons. I know if I go buy it now I will be to eager not to touch it.   
There are plenty of online tutorials on YT that show how to hold the bow and start playing but I am wondering if it would be bad to start learning on my own for a few months before going to a teacher. Suppose I start to create bad habbits... Will that be a big deal?

But the Canon in D is a tremendously beautiful and well composed piece, which just suffers from being played to death, and often played like death. Für elise is a lot less interesting, and does not get quite the same level of hate.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I'm a new member to the subreddit so if there are any mistakes in my post or sources I can refer to such as a subreddit wiki, please point me in the right direction.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, onto the topic of this post. I've been playing cello for around 5 1/2 years, and recently moved from Massachusetts to Korea. I used to play a rental that I enjoyed for its smooth, even tone and decent projection. It was from Johnson Strings, and I think it was from Eastman. As I was moving internationally, I decided to return the rental to Johnsons, and look for a new cello to use in Korea. Unfortunately, when I first arrived and started looking for options, things didn't seem to be up to standard. Most cellos I saw had a muffled tone, poor wood quality, tone, and strings were too high off the bridge. Pegs and fingerboards also seemed to be painted black instead of being genuine ebony, and no one really had any higher end cellos than the aforementioned starter ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, I've been considering ordering online from a reputable cello dealer to get something like a Jay Haide a l'ancienne of the ruggieri variant, or a Snow SC200 kind of thing. However, I'm rather anxious about not being able to try it out in person. Do you guys think it's better to keep searching around for a local luthier and shop? Or is it better to get a cello online. If so, are there any models you guys would recommend, or sites to order from?

The other instruments I’ve played were not like that at all. I will be taking it back to the place I’m renting from and to swap for better instrument, or just rent from the other shop.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student .

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

TLDR: Church Music good for practice - better than etude - claims Bach fanboi

I just wanted to give all you budding cellists looking for some good material to sink your teeth into a little tip which have enormously helped me in my journey (I've been playing for about a year and a half now).

If you find yourself a little bored with Dotzauer and Popper, which I admit on occasion I have, and want something that is moderately easy to play, yet sounds good, I would suggest a little foray into (hold on to your bows) ...church music!

No matter what your religious stance might be, there is no denying that there is a well of beautiful music written for the church through the ages. And, luckily for all beginners, it exists at all levels of complexity and difficulty. Bach alone wrote over 250 cantatas, for instance, and a lot of them have been preserved. Moreover, some of the most popular and, dare I say, beautiful pieces have been arranged for the cello (as well as for other instruments).

To illustrate, let me just point you to one of my favorites: ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring"", derived from a chorale part of the Cantata ""Heart and Mouth and Deed and Life"" by J.S. Bach (BWV 147). 

Now, maybe a lot of you are quite familiar with this, but I must admit I was not until I, rather randomly, came across an arrangement for Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring for the cello (Link to some free sheet music to try below).

It is a stunningly beautiful piece, and was (to me at least) a welcome break from Sensei Suzuki and Hr. Dotzauer. And, although it has some shifts into higher positions, it is not all that difficult to play. 

I will admit to playing this piece for hours and it is such a beautiful little gem - almost meditative. You can also practice your vibrato on the melody parts, which is an added bonus. (If you struggle with vibrato, you can always claim you don't want to use vibrato because it is a Baroque piece when performing for friends and family, so a win-win there also ;-D)

Better still, you get to play something that is pretty sweet on the ears and practice some position shifts and vibrato at the same time. And you get just a little bit familiar with Bach which might come in handy later if you are eyeing the Cello Suites, for instance.

I am a total Bach fanboi, so if you absolutely hate Bach, then the piece below maybe might not be for you. There is, however, a lot of other pieces out there written for (or adapted by) the church into hymns you can explore. Everything from Händel to traditional music, and a lot of it is easily available.

This turned into a rant, and I apologize.

Here is a link to a free cello arrangement for Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring:

I am a beginning-ish violin player with around 3 years of experience.  I am not terribly good, but at my best was at least working on things like the Vivaldi concerto in A minor.  I have developed an elbow problem that might necessitate ""retiring"" from the instrument.  In a nutshell, if I extend my elbow fully or nearly so and rotate my wrist heavily towards the thumb side (as when bowing down towards the tip of the bow), a tendon snaps over a nerve in my elbow and hurts like crazy and does the nerve no good at all.

I am going to try a 3/4 bow and see if that helps, but it was also suggested that I consider a different instrument.  Piano was the first suggested, but a violist friend also mentioned cello.  Cello sounds more appealing on face, as I had considered it when I started taking music lessons and I am supposing that some of what I currently know might translate.

So my question is this, especially for anyone with experience with both instruments: is the bowing motion for cello likely to result in the same position of my arm/elbow (extended at the elbow and pronated at the wrist and forearm the same time)?  This is purely a hobby of mine and I don't want to screw up that nerve, nor pick something else up and discover that I can't do it when the material gets remotely challenging.

Student,1618700171,mt11em,"Hey everyone just a bit of advice from a seasoned teacher. I see so many people around me getting into teaching and I think its awesome. This pandemic has been bad on so many levels but for some reason has really inspired people to take cello lessons and people have been rising to the occasion and making a bit of money. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just a word of warning, late spring/summertime is usually the dry season for lessons. People go on vacation, spring sports start up, people just want to take a break, etc etc. In this case things are opening back up here in the states so people might suddenly find they don't have the time to take lessons. Nice parents/students phase you out and let you know in advance but a surprising amount of people will just hit you with ""This is Jonny's last lesson, he is going to be doing \[insert sport here\] and we just don't have the time!"" and then you are out that money. 

&amp;#x200B;

So just a little cautionary bit of advice here for everyone who has started making money teaching, Plan on your students all staying with you, but also don't quit your day job if you know what I mean. It's hard to find new students in the summer so hold onto the ones you have and save your pennies, it will open back up in september when people get back to school.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student .

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

,1617759293,mlr6i8,"Hello,

I'm a casual amateur player, but I plan on trying out for a higher-level community orchestra once the pandemic is over. I've played cello on and off since mid-2000's, and finished RCM 10 in 2013 (played St. Saens Concerto No.1). My ultimate music goal is to be able to play difficult cello pieces with ease.

My current cello is worth around $2.5k and has decent projection. My cello teachers said that it sounded good enough for the RCM exams and student honour orchestras.

My current bow is the one that came with the cello, and it's beginning to show a lot of wear and tear.

Because I have just finished my university degree, I have very little disposable income to spend on my instrument. I currently have the following problems:

1. The bow's wires are partially corroded, and there's a slight dip on the stick where I place my thumb (because I used to be a very tense player). There's an uneven distribution of bow hair tension (slacker hair towards the thumb side (vs the side with other fingers)). When I got it rehaired a few years ago, they told me it may be more cost-efficient to get a new bow instead.
2. My D string buzzes, which I believe is because the groove on the nut is too big for the string.
3. I feel like it takes too much energy to get my bows going from full stop. I am not sure if this is because of aging strings (a few years old...I should really switch them out!) or because the bowhair's worn out. Rosining the bow more doesn't seem to help.
4. It's harder to vary dynamics/do different bowing techniques on my cello compared to the $4k ones they had on display at a music store.
5. My cello's got a lot of little scratches because I was very clumsy as a teenager.

I am currently planning on getting a new bow, a new set of strings and possibly a new nut. However, I recently read/heard on online forums that people tend to upgrade their instruments for ones that cost about $5k (or more) at my level, and I am wondering if I should be saving up to get a new instrument instead.

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

**Zoom details:**

**To be added right here shortly before the meeting!**  
**Note that the UK switched to summer time, so this meeting is at 8pm BST!**

I was tuning my cello today and the A-string snapped.

If something fell out of place, that would be an even bigger ""operation"" to fix my cello.

Also, if I've never replaced a string before should I find a professional to take it to or is it easy enough to replace yourself? I've watched some videos and read about putting on a new string and it doesn't look that complicated but who knows.",Cello,Storing a cello with a broken string,,0

It's like I somehow haven't earned to easily tune my cello.

I took the right hand of the score, brought it one octave down (because come on) and touched it up a little in a few spots unsuitable for cello.

,1616893778,mer9h2,"Hello everyone, I need some advice for my future.

I’m currently a senior in highschool, and I’m about to head off to my first semester of college in the fall. I am still waiting for a few college decisions, but I will most likely attend the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA (it’s the best college I've been accepted to so far). I tried applying for a few music schools/majors, but with asian parents, it has never been my intention to actually pursue music by itself. My goal was to double major in cello performance and economics/business, and my parents allowed that.

Music wise, I am a very passionate cellist. I have taken private lessons for almost 8 years, attended a summer festival, won a few competitions, and applied to a few music schools and conservatories. I am due to perform a solo debut concert of the Shostakovich Cello Concerto with the Augusta Symphony in May and soon recording Dvorak’s Cello Concerto Mvt.1 for a performance for Carnegie Hall. I am quite confident in my abilities, and I wish to continue improving and exploring cello performance in college. I’m no Juilliard or Curtis caliber musician, but I believe I could do great at a music school (say Eastman or Berkeley, still two great schools). However, I never really had the option to apply for all the music schools I wanted, because of my parents. So I took a shot at 2 schools, both which came back negative.

I want to continue pursuing music and cello performance in college, but GT simply does not have any music. It only has an orchestra. No faculty, no affiliated quartet or teachers, nothing that will really satisfy a passionate, competitive, and determined cellist.

So my question for you guys is, if I attend GT next fall, how would you all suggest that I continue pursuing music at a high level? If my school doesn't offer much, how do I continue my intensive studies independently? I know that I could also just continue what I’m currently doing in high school (taking private lessons, competing in private competitions, audition for summer festivals, etc.) but I really wanted to be in a college that has those opportunities for me. 

Much appreciated. Thank you!

,1616876646,meluvf,"Listening to youtube videos of Vocalise on the cello, I find about 50/50 between being played in the original C#minor (there's a Yo Yo Ma and a Rostropovich, for example) and in Eminor.  Yet the cello scores are all in Em. In the original key, Ma was able to play the repeats an octave higher

Heifetz arranged and played it in E minor on the violin - I'm guessing that was when the key change was popularised - so my geeky question is why the key change was made on violin and cello from the original very haunting C#minor. Are there technical reasons?  I know Vocalise gets freely transcribed for the vocal range of singers, but here the string instrument ""is"" the vocal part - and C#minor seems well within the cello range.

,1615940822,m6nm41,"Hi all I am fairly new to vibrato. I can get what I think is a reasonable vibrato given how long I've been practising it on all four fingers. However I specifically have trouble when switching from one finger to the first finger.

The cause seems obvious: when playing, with or without vibrato, on another finger, the first finger is not in a position where it can strike the fingerboard perpendicularly - it is tilted back towards the scroll. (I play with my other fingers pretty much perpendicular, as I was taught.) This causes quite a bit of awkwardness and delay in commencing vibrato - basically I am moving my thumb up to be directly opposite the index finger, rotating the hand so it's perpendicular, then starting.

Are there any hints for this situation, or non-obvious exercises? Or is it just a matter of practising playing something on another finger, then switching to one and trying to vibrate as quickly as possible?",Cello,Starting vibrato on first finger immediately after changing fingers,,0
,1615939278,m6n42q,"Here are a few pro tips that can dramatically affect your performance.  

First if you are interested, check this website out for a more thorough understanding of how your cello works. https://www.aitchisoncellos.com/article-library/technical-articles-about-the-cello/

If you are not having a beautiful sound, or getting frustrated playing go to a luthier that works with professional musicians, not your local mom and pop luthier. Email a university with a string instrument department and email the professor to recommend a good luthier for you.

point 1: get bow rehaired every 6 months. The bow rehair is the difference between eyesight with glasses and eyesight without glasses.  The clarity of the instrument is greatly affected. It has something to do with ionic charge and its ability to attract the rosin. The bow works much better and you can put more of your heart into the instrument. 

point 2:  check for bridge warping.  If its warped, its best to get it dewarped.  it will affect the sound pretty moderately.Luthier can do this readily. 

point 3: check if their is air  you can see at the bridge feet.  if there is air you need to loosen the strings and flex the bridge back into the correct position.  If you are scared, get a luthier to do it and then show you how its done. 

point 4: soundpost  position:  If your instrument is not sounding good, the luthier can adjust your soundpost or  bridge and it should be less wolfy and more clear and resonant.  soundpost position is the touchstone of  a great playing sounding instrument and a poorly sounding instrument. Every instrument and how it sounds is beyond what modern computers and physics can predict.  Very subtle deviations can affect the whole instrument. 

point 5:  get new strings.  If you havent changed your strings in about 6 months to a year get new ones.  They are expensive but you want to reduce all sources of problems 



Final point:  use your cello to express your heart and soul.  If you had problems with your heart you would go to a Dr. If you had problems with your soul you would go to God.   If you have problems with your cello, since its a proxy for your heart and soul,  go to a good luthier.

I'm a cellist and professional musician in Canada. I dislocated my finger in an accident one week ago, and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with recovery from an injury like this? I attached a photo of my x-ray for reference. The attending physician in the ER said that if I had ligament damage I could be referred to a surgeon, but she didn't indicate that there was that much damage. 

So far, I still have very limited mobility, and am unable to play. I have been icing daily, and wearing a splint, though I make sure to try and move my finger a little bit every day. It is still quite painful, and I don't want to push it. My range of motion right now allows my finger to fully straighten, though it is mildly painful, and I cannot make a fist. I can form a fist with all my other fingers, but my intermediate and distal phalanges extend outward about 45 degrees compared to their neighboring joints. Trying to move them further than this causes quite a bit of pain. There is a physiotherapist that is a hand specialist about 8 hours away from me, and I intend to see him as soon as possible (tough with Covid, but I am getting vaccinated this week).

This was how it was even back in HS. I love my mute! It takes away the brassiness and I just play better because the tone sounds nicer and boosts my ego. 

Anyone knows if there’s something I can change to make my unmuted cello sound better? Or is this a common thing? 

A few likely culprits:
-strings are probably old af. I don’t know when most people replace them but they are easily 6 years old. I’ve recently read some people remove built up rosin from strings with an alcohol solution but I’ve never tried that. 
-my bowing. I’m sure it’s saw like and not nearly as precise as it should be
-my left hand. I’ve never seemed to be able to get that rich sound that other people get

My hands are extremely weak and I put most of the blame on them. Even when I was playing every day, RIP pinky if I tried vibrato. My fingers lock up like crazy, especially when they get tired, and often slip on strings. Same for my bowing hand. The OG advice I got was to hold the frog like a coke bottle. I don’t not do that, and my pinky does lock up there too.",Cello,Does anyone think their instrument sounds much better with a mute?,,0

I am an adult beginner. I am currently working on Suzuki 2 and will finish it soon-sh I hope! Before I move on to the next Suzuki book, I'm just checking out my options.... I'm considering supplementing with another series of books because I don't loooveee the Suzuki tunes and want something more fun/romantic/expressive in addition to still working on a few Suzuki pieces and etudes, scales, etc. with a teacher. 

I'm wondering if these books are good. And, if so, how would you recommend incorporating them in to the practice routine? Are the levels comparative to Suzuki? Where should I start?

The **available days are** Friday (March 26th), Saturday (March 27th), and Sunday (March 28th). You can perform anything you want. Our recommendation is to perform something you've been working on recently. 

**How it works:** you connect to a voice channel, unmute yourself, and perform. No one can see you. After you finish performing, you can mute yourself again, and listen to other performers. 😊 

🌟 We also have an event performance on March 25th (Thursday), for which members will perform something in honor of **Béla Bartók** (it's his 140th birthday anniversary). If you want to perform on this day, the only requirement is for the music to be **Hungarian** ♪

Any **hesitation**? How I think about this, is, no one knows who I am, so it doesn't matter what the listeners think. I am performing for myself, and I'm practicing *my performance skill.* That's why I try to perform every month!

I am a (not great) cellist, who very recently got my cello back after not having it for 2 years. Unfortunately before I parted with it I was more of a kid and just wanted to play stuff on it, almost never practiced, and when I did I did not focus on technique, so while my teacher in school tried to push me and I improved, I never really made it past 4th position. Now that I've got the cello back I am loving it and actually focusing on improvement and learning, rebuilding my fundamentals. 

I would love some advice or recommendations of practice material/techniques for practicing my shifting, as I don't do enough of that right now, and advice for learning and practicing positions past 4th, as I just barely started to learn that before I stopped. 

Maybe I should mention that most of my shifting practice is during my repertoire practice as I am relearning Mendelssohn's student concerto for cello in D major, one of my old high school exam pieces.

Big fan of this community and how it helps anyone from each and every cello background!
I have had two issues lately and I wondered if somebody could help me with them.

The first issue is a maintenance problem. After each practice I always wipe the neck, the fretboard and the strings (and of course the bow). Yet it often feels yucky, sticky and unclean when I practice next day. I have the fortunate opportunity being able to practice each day, but I play a lot and this I sweat a lot.

The second problem I have is with the strings. About three months ago I bought new strings and was very happy. They sounded and felt great. Whenever I was done playing, one wipe and the resin disappeared from the strings. Then I played for a few weeks without wiping the fretboard or the the strings. As a result, it was incredibly hard to remove the solid resin from the strings and fretboard, but I eventually succeeded. Now however, the resin sticks to the strings really hard whenever I am done playing. It isn’t easily removed. I have tried cleaning the strings with alcohol, but it only had a short lasting effect. Now I spend a few minutes after each practice, slowly removing the resin from the strings.

,1615510237,m35ftm,"Our next meetup will be **this Saturday, again at 8 PM Scottish time (GMT).** For those that haven't joined before: **Our meetups are supposed to be fun and super-casual.** Those that want to play and share some of the music they are currently working on, are welcome to do so. Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

Here is the context: I have a rental cello since a couple of months. It’s nice enough but I’m definitely giving it back in summer. It is a relatively new cello from 2019 and it looks pristine so I suppose it’s not “played in” yet. At home I practice 100% with an Artino mute on, there is simply no other way as I live in an block of flats. I know it’s not optimal but it’s better than nothing. 

Now to my question - I remember seeing a YouTube video where a professional cellist was saying that a cello’s wooden body imprints the vibrations from the sounds played on it, and this is why good intonation is important not only for the obvious reasons of enjoyable music but also for the instrument in the long run.

,1614900512,lxyg0w,"Our next meetup will be **this Saturday, again at 8 PM Scottish time (GMT).** For those that haven't joined before: **Our meetups are supposed to be fun and super-casual.** Those that want to play and share some of the music they are currently working on, are welcome to do so. Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

This week is the week of CelloFest, an international cello festival in my home country. It is organized by Sibelius Academy’s cello professor, Martti Rousi and french cellist Laura Martin in collaboration with Sibelius Academy.

I have several questions.

3) Hoe time consuming is adding a finger number, etc.? During a lesson I can quickly scratch numbers in my music and tidy them up later. Is rapid editing possible with forScore?

I'm an adult cello learner; I've had quite some years of piano lessons as a kid. I've struggled with rhythm my whole life, the focus was always more on the melody in my piano lessons. 

Recently, I found the app Rhythm Trainer (available for iOs and Android) and it has been immensly helpful for training my sense of rhythm when reading scores. The app has 200andsomething excercises, ranging from beginner to expert. You can do 10 mins of free excercises a day - a perfect amount of daily training time if you ask me. 

But the best thing: it reacts to mistakes you make. If you struggle on a rhythm, it slows down the tempo for you and slowly builds it up again once you got the right rhythm. It tells you if you are rushing a rhythm and gives you visual clues on the mistakes you made. You can take a placement test so you don't have to start from the beginning if you are more advanced. I simply cannot recommend this app enough, it is awesome. Try it out yourself if rhythm is also something you've ignored for a long time, like me :)",Cello,Struggling with rhythm?

As a music teacher I always wanted an easy way for my students to learn a bit more about music theory. So last year I started on a quest to make an app to allow exactly that.

You can:

* Learn music theory step by step (from basic naturals to intervals, chords/scales to progressions)
* Learn ear-training at the same time (optional)
* Read information in the in-app wiki
* Play any interval, chord, scale from any tonic in the playground

I'd love it if you guys try it and give me some feedback on what to improve.

I’m an undergraduate Performance major looking to get more volunteer teaching experience. I noticed that a lot of people on the sub are having trouble finding private teachers (especially ones that they can afford because professionals are very expensive). At the same time, my studio has a few spots open. So, through the month of March, I wanted to offer some free half-hour Zoom lessons to any interested cellists at the beginner or intermediate level.

What we work on in those few weeks is entirely up to your needs--we can do solo repertoire, scales, orchestra music, or whatever you would find it most helpful to work on/have an introduction to. (Even if you wanna just ask a few personalized technical questions, I’d be happy to assist!) In the absence of any prepared repertoire, I can recommend some things befitting your level of experience.

I won’t put my full bio here, but I’ve been teaching for three years (one of those years fully online). As a student myself, I went to All-State Orchestra, graduated from some fairly renowned summer institutes, was principal in all my youth orchestras, and got a fellowship at my current university. (I’m a serious student cellist who’s also very serious about teaching! Just hoping I can be of service to the general cello-ing community. And, of course, it's nice getting volunteer hours while meeting other cool musicians!)

If you’re interested or want to know more about me, feel free to send a DM! I can take probably a maximum of eight students this month, but if more are interested, I’ll happily do this again in April and maybe beyond.

,1614022384,lpxjjo,"Hi everyone, this post is not so much a question but a couple observations, although of course comments are very welcome. 

1) I have a wold of F, a wolf-killer solves the problem well when I play without a mute (which is only when I'm at my teacher's studio). I have an Artino mute and it seems to bring some ""wolfiness"" back. The mute does not fit very well though as my bridge is quite thick, i can probably get it to sit on the top 5mm of the bridge, but it still does the job. 

2) My A2 if very boomy, it is as loud as an open string and the whole cello seems to ""emanate"" it more than any other stopped note, even with a mute on. I don't mind it really, I like the sound, I'm just wondering if there is a particular reason for it. 

3) Rosin seems to make a big difference. I like Pirastro Olive but I also have bought Cecilia which had such high ratings, but unless I apply A LOT more weight to the bow, my notes get all squeaky on Cecilia - I've tried it several times now on two acoustic cellos with the same result.

I really did love playing the cello, but eventually I just decided it wasn’t worth continuing to pay for lessons if I could barely practice at all in between. By the end of a 45 minute lesson, I often couldn’t even bend my fingers, and it took almost the full week to recover, and by then it was time for my next lesson. 

Within the last year, I’ve started a new medication for my arthritis, and it has worked incredibly. I haven’t had any pain or swelling at all in months. I’ve started to play my cello again, just in my free time. I feel like a beginner again. The issue I’m having now is that I just don’t feel as strong as I used to be. I find it takes so much strength to hold down the strings, and my left hand is exhausted after a short session. I find it especially difficult to change notes quickly because of how much force I exert to press the strings to the fingerboard. 

I know I will likely gain back some of my strength with practice, but is there anything I can do in the meantime that will make my cello less physically demanding to play? New strings for example? I have no idea what strings I have currently as it’s been so long since I’ve changed them. Could I get my bridge filed down to reduce the distance I need to press the strings to touch the fingerboard? Would a new bow help? I’m even willing to sacrifice a little sound quality as I’m not performing in front of anybody anytime soon. I just really want to get back to playing, without putting too much strain on my joints.

I’m open to any recommendations. I’m willing to spend a little, but I am a university student so I don’t currently have a fortune. For information, I live in Canada, and will likely have to order everything online because of where I’m located, but there is a luthier within driving distance.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

,1613674013,lmtyhd,"My daughter has a half-size cello and I have the worst time getting the thing in tune, and wonder if anyone has any tips? I’ve never experienced this issue with a violin, but the pegs slide all the way back on their own when I turn them. The A string is the worst. It desperately wants to be tuned to F#. Every day she has (virtual) orchestra, I am literally wrestling with it to try to make that peg stay where I put it. 

The last time I took the thing for new strings, the luthier didn’t seem to think there was a problem and it tuned just fine for him (because of course it did). It could be a humidity issue currently, but it doesn’t explain why it was still happening when the heat wasn’t cranked up. (And overall we’re in a pretty humid climate; only in winter do I run a humidifier.) 

But I’m at my wit’s end, it took me nearly ten minutes to tune a cello and my hand hurts from trying to push the peg in deeper.

,1613366815,lk6me6,"Hello,

I know that this forum may lean heavily towards Cello, but I would like some honest opinions. 

**Right now, I am the crossroads of trying to choose a musical instrument. I have barely touched a musical instrument before, minus the usual stuff( recorder in Junior High, a few piano lessons as a child, rock guitar for a few months during high school.** 

**So, I am kind of picking my first instrument.  I am torn between the Cello and Double Bass.  Here is what draws me to each of them:**

**Pros of the Cello:**

**1. From an analogy from my other hobby Role Playing Video Games, you could say that the Cello is the Red Mage of stringed instruments. It can play Violin like melody parts, Harmony parts and Bass-like bass parts. This is analogous to Red Mages from some Role Playing video games who can use swords, cast white magic spells and black magic spells. Versatile within a genre.** 

**2. There are, as some inexpensive starter Cello's.  I am not sure if and where any cheap starter Double Basses exist**

**3. Cellos's are easier to transport than Double Basses.** 

**4. I am a fan of many musical movie theme soundtracks such as as Cider House Rules, Titanic, Shawshank Redemption, Downton Abbey, or Trading Places. All of these soundtracks are have some heavy string pieces. I definitely will be able to play such pieces with a Cello. I also enjoy some famous classical pieces such as Pachelbel's Cannon and the Overture to Marriage of Figaro. Additionally, I am a deep fan of a few rock songs where strings play a guest role. I wonder if anyone here has ever heard Ozzy Osbourne's ""So Tired.""** 

**5. There is emerging versatility across genre's with the Cello, including one Cello Based heavy metal band.** 

**Pros of the Double Bass:**

**1. I have heard that since there is larger room on the bow and you have to be less exact about hand placement, the Double Bass is easier for beginners to learn.**

**2. While the Cello has the most versatility within the genre of classical music and is starting to emerge across genre's, the Double Bass has more current versatility across genre's . It is established in Jazz bands and even a few rock groups.** 

**3. The Double Bass is a major staple in one of my many favorite kinds of music. Hawaiian music as in the Cazimero Brothers, Do Ho, Peter Moon Band. My late father was from Hawaii and the Double Bass known as an upright bass is a staple in most small scale Hawaiian musical acts. Playing the Double Bass would enable me to be participate in a Hawaiian style ensemble.** 

**4. From what I hear, Double Bass players are very much in demand.** 

**My questions are the following:**

**1. Would you have any suggestions between deciding between the Cello vs. Double Bass?**

**2. Are there any good suggestions you would have on where to obtain a good starter Double Bass kit?**

**3. How difficult is it to switch from the Cello to Double Bass and vice versa in case I want to change from one to the other or do both?**

**I would tremendously appreciate any thoughts or suggestions.** ",Cello,Adult Learner trying to decide between Bass and Cello,,0

I'm doing the whole twisting-pushing thing as I tune and turning slowly. Twice as I've been doing this, I've snapped a string (while still far below the pitch, so it wasn't overtension). 

Today, it was the same thing again, except this time there was a loud bang and the bridge was suddenly on the floor. 

1. What should I do in the short-term? Loosen the strings and leave it? Try and put it back on?  The soundpost is still fitted. Do I just have to not practice until I can take it back to the luthier?
2. Does this seem normal to have such issues with the pegs? It's not the most expensive rental, and I'm wondering if it would be worth trying another cello/luthier? Is it just user error, even though I have no idea what I could be doing wrong. I do have a teacher, but we're only doing video lessons right now, so it's tricky to figure things out.

I’d like to preface this by saying that I’ve played since I was four. I am now 17, and I’ve played in many concerts and orchestras. 

Despite my experience, I’ve always had trouble with my bow hold. Firstly, if my middle finger opposes my my thumb and sits on the metal, I feel like I have no stability. When I’m required to play pieces which are aggressive and technical, my fourth finger will immediately take the place of my third, so I can drive all the weight into my first finger.

This, while allowing me to play louder, causes great pain and reduces my endurance considerably. My thumb will also occasionally slip through the hole and I am constantly adjusting my hand due to the discomfort. All this is only an issue in the a string, but I need some serious advice.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

,1613079710,lhvl05,"Hi cello Reddit!

I just got my cello back from a violin shop to replace a snapped bridge and re-set the sound post. After playing for only a minute or so I’m feeling that the action seems absurdly high... but I want to make sure I am in the right before complaining. 

A couple of things: 

Reading online I found someone suggest that the height from the end of fingerboard to strings should be 6mm at A and 8mm at G... I measured and currently it’s at 9 and 11 respectively. Did I measure from the right place? I measured from where the end of the fingerboard stops, so, the closest point to the bridge. 

And then... not that I am opposed in any way to supporting my local luthiers, but the cost for this was $370. When I looked around to find measurements it seems like this is quite high? Does anyone have an opinion on that? This is not a “fine” cello. It’s upper amateur at best, I think valued at $1400

Lastly, just another thing I want to check... and again, I am asking here *so that* i don’t come off as overly prissy when I chat about it with them... it is hard to tell that this bridge was carved. If it were, would it be pretty obvious? 

Thanks. It’s possible that I just am misremembering the previous action but it sure feels high.",Cello,"New bridge, action seems high",,0

 Also, her wrist moves very smoothly and loosely especially when she’s going from a down bow to an up bow. I hope I’m explaining this right.

I'm a firm believer in bettering one's self, and I'm a committed lifetime learner. As a middle-aged person now, I have kids, and I have taken my career to where I want it to be. I don't have any more degrees or certifications that I'd like to achieve professionally. I'd really like to learn more about music. I've played cello and other instruments my entire life, but I've never taken a cello exam. I've played a lot of the RCM grade 9 rep, and a little bit of grade 10 rep. If I commit to playing more cello, I would probably start with the Grade 10 RCM rep. (I have passed the RCM grade 6 piano exam. That's my only RCM qualification)

I was wondering what your thoughts were on getting an ARCT? Is it worth the time investment? Is it really feasible for someone over 40 who might not learn as quickly as a youth? Are there some other certifications I might want to consider instead?

If I don't take the ARCT, I might just explore digging into some more complicated rep with a teacher. However, I don't think I would be able to motivate myself to take on some of the requirements, especially the technical, without having a goal to reach towards.

,1612958025,lgs2yj,"I am entering the wonderful world of vibrato and am finding it much easier to get a nice, fluid-sounding vibrato if I allow the final (distal) joint of the finger to ""collapse"" and straighten. This makes the fingertip meet the string at a more oblique angle, putting more of the pad onto the string and fingerboard. This makes the vibrato wider and also increases the amount of friction between finger and cello, meaning less downward force is needed to prevent the finger sliding. I also find it easier for the pumping motion of the arm to induce a rotation in the hand and finger like this - with a curved finger I get a narrower, shaking motion of the hand rather than rotation.

So, everything I've been taught and everything I've seen online lauds curved fingers in both basic playing and in vibrato. Most cellists vibrate with curved fingers and their hands rotate just fine. So: have I blundered into a dead end that I should abandon before it becomes a habit (which probably will just be a couple of weeks until my next lesson) or is this something that real cellists (who aren't Yo-Yo Ma...) do without issues?

Is there a way to achieve something similar without collapsing the final finger joint? I've tried lowering my elbow but it feels awkward. I think part of the issue is that I have very long nail beds, so when the fingers strike the fingerboard straight down, even with the nails filed right down, I think I have less surface area of fingertip touching the fingerboard than an average person - this might contribute to the lack of friction I described.

It's currently an extremely cold dry winter in Chicago, and my house humidity is at a steady 20%, lol. 

I've been considering where to keep my instrument because I don't want it to be damaged. I set up a humidifier in my room overnight to see how high I could get the humidity and see if I could keep it in there. It got up to 36 in the middle of the night, but then it ran out of water and when I woke up, the humidity was back at 20%.

I don't know any celloists in real life so I was thinking I could find some assist here from you guys!

I'm a total beginner with classical instruments, and cello is the one that resonates with me the most.
As far as I know it's expensive to upkeep of course due to the delicacy of the instruments.

But to the point, I want a cello for my own musical projects, I'm not going to achieve professionality with cello as an instrument. I'm not going to perform with the instrument. Are here any other similar people who I could discuss price ranges, models and experiences on cello as just a hobby and fun?

So my left wrist hasn’t been feeling so good for the past 4 weeks. I just got an MRI done and it was concluded my TFCC (triangular fibrocartilage complex) has a COMPLETE tear on the ulnar side (that is, the side of my wrist close to the pinky). 

TFCC tears are usually due to trauma (like falling on an outstretched hand). However I don’t remember falling down. Another possible cause is excessive arm rotation. I know vibrato features forearm rotation. But would it be bad enough to cause a complete tear of my cartilage?

I also know too much tension could lead to injuries but my left hand is pretty relaxed. I’ve learnt pretty well to “hang” instead of squeezing the fingerboard. Also it doesn’t hurt my hand/wrist when I try my vibrato right now.

,1612054178,l90dx7,"Hi all! I'm not sure if this is a stupid question or not haha, but I figured I'd try.

I'm currently planning to buy my first cello. I think I'm going to teach myself. I used to play piano and a wind instrument for a few years, but the only other string instrument I've dabbled with is guitar and that never stuck, so I'm excited to start cello. So excited in fact that I want to begin learning now, before I even get my instrument.

It'll probably be a month or two before that happens because I'm still saving up and want to make sure I get a decent first cello (If anyone has any suggestions, that would be appreciated too!). So my question is, does anyone have any ideas on how I could start physically learning the fingering and notes and getting used to them? I had an idea of making a makeshift fingerboard and just ""practicing"" on that, but I'm not sure if that would work lol.

I'd also just like to preface.. I practically know nothing about cellos, never played any instrument in the bass clef, and I also have to re-learn how to read music again lol. So I'm not really sure if trying to teach myself fingerings first is the best choice, or if I should start off with something else first if that's possible?

I would really appreciate any advice or opinions! Thank you!",Cello,Practicing cello without a cello?,,0
,1612040726,l8vp2u,"Violinist here looking to buy strings for a cello.. 

For violin dominant strings are seen by and large as the ""default"" string--they are a neutral string that is high quality, yet they can be found at a lower price than many of the high end strings. And despite new more expensive strings coming out every year, they are still favored by many world class professionals.

I thought I might be able to find the equivalent for cello, but it seems that it might be more complicated.

It's a professional quality cello, so I'm interested in buying quality strings for it, and I know they will be pricey (especially coming as a violinist). But the cello does not get played that often, only when the owner visits, a few days a month (but maybe more soon). So if the cello string market is anything like violin, I don't need anything over the top like the most expensive ultra-loud soloist strings. I am interested what exists as far as high quality relatively neutral string.. if that makes sense.

I know every instrument is different, but where do folks usually start? Thanks!

edit: I've identified the current strings as medium spirocore C and G, superflexible D and A. I'm inclined to get the same or similar, but these strings are very old, so if comparable strings are more common or well liked these days let me know. Also interested in if there is a way to identify if the spirocores are tungsten or silver? And do you think the difference is worth the price jump, especially given how little the cello gets played?",Cello,violinist with cello string question,,0

Why this cello is worth more than a CSO (I hope Cello Shaped Object is a thing): 
Mischa Maisky played on it, and was very positive about the instrument.

After hearing of the project and trying out the instrument Roel Dieltjens (prominent Belgian Cellist) has put his shoulders under the project and is also auctioning most of his sheet music (including his personal notes of course), this will be about 620 books of cello music.


The auction will include some fun oddities as well such as a handwritten letter by Giacomo Puccini.

For the past couple of months, I've felt really out of touch with my cello.

It's felt really depressing, and I've been hesitant to pick my cello up and practice, because it always feels like I'm doing everything wrong. 

I'm not sure what changed, but today I finally felt comfortable enough to connect with my cello beyond posture and form. I was thinking of all the pieces I love that attracted me to play the cello in the first place. Bach, and Brahms and Dvorak especially. I also thought of the ensembles I'm, in and the musicians I'm connecting with.

It feels just like I did when I was first starting out in middle school, but now with a little more discipline and technique.  I feels like I have a future to work towards. I don't mind the scales and exercises so much. It all makes a little more sense.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

I recently bought my second cello, it’s an old French 3/4 (had to go down from full size because of my tiny hands and shoulder problems) and I have no idea how old it is. It’s been restored recently so it’s probably old enough to have acquired some damage in its life. I don’t think it’s really really old, but my guess is it’s not a recent make. 

I’m super curious about how old it might be and it’s history. All I know is it’s French, which is about all the previous owner told me beyond that it’s been restored under their supervision. I was wondering if anybody had any tips for figuring out how old an instrument is? Are there certain features or distinctions between cellos made in different periods? 

There’s no maker’s label inside anywhere I can see, and I realise that there probably isn’t any solid way to figure out its age but I thought here was the right place to ask :)

I have a student whose previous teacher allowed him to advance in his Suzuki repertoire way too early, and he is missing some technique and skills.

It's nowhere near the level of proficiency for it to be passed off.

He's been on this piece for a really long time, and it is obvious that he isn't practicing. I've dedicated entire lessons to get him to actually practice his music, but he doesn't.

Anyway, at our last lesson, he wept tears of frustration because he is ""bored of his music and wants to move on.""

I know this was discussed on other topics already, but I tried everything that was advised and nothing seems to help, to I just wanted to start this one to see if there is anything else I could do.

Basically, similar as others, whenever I am playing the D and A strings, my shoulder gets really fatigued really fast - the feeling is similar as I was at the gym working out the muscle isolated.

It's not the entire shoulder, it's just the right shoulder lateral deltoid, and the weird thing is that I am not even shrugging my shoulder. It feels really relax, so I'm assuming I might be ""activating"" the wrong muscle while bowing.

I tried a lot of different things - cello angle, bow grips - but nothing seems to work. It's frustrating because I can't practice as much as I want, because I don't want to ""force"" the muscle (worried that it could get worse).

I was having issues with my thumb as well (sometimes both shoulder and thumb was hurting at the same time), but seems like I was able to fix the thumb issue partially by changing my bow grip.

I'm playing Cello for a little more than a month now, and currently I am playing a lot of open strings only just to try to find a good position that may help with this, but no luck so far...

Any other advice of what I could do here? :( - I really want to play the cello, but I'm honestly considering changing back to Violin because I can't get rid of this fatigue...

Any advice is much appreciated! :) - I will add a small video here of me playing, in case that helps.

[25 foot headphone extender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CNAV2YW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

This is certainly not an industry grade connector but it you are like me and use cheapo earbuds then this will let you walk around and stuff. Try not to run over it with your chair. 

[Symbio eartips](https://symbioeartips.com/)

These were an interesting find. They are essentially an earbud tip shaped foam earplug covered with a  silicone protector. They are pretty noise isolating and once you get the hand of putting them in pretty comfy. You have to pinch and roll them a bunch and then push them in for like 3-5 seconds. They also come from Hungary so if you are cheap like me and don't get the tracked mail expect 2-3 weeks for shipping. 

[Panasonic earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SKY2QQR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

These are super cheap but have a really nice sound, especially combined with the eartips above. Honestly I replace them when they break and I go through like a pair a year. But that was with commuting and stuff so I am hoping these will last longer. 

[10 foot long usb 3.0 extender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008219UMI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

[Amazon basics boom stands](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019NY2PKG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

These are pretty cheap quality and I would not trust an expensive microphone or my ipad on them. However for lights and other stuff and cheaper more durable microphones these are pretty neat. Good in a pinch. 

[forscore App for ipad](https://forscore.co/)

This is essential if you are trying to do music on your Ipad. Seriously check this app out its the bees knees. 

[reflector 3 ipad mirroring app](https://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector)

This little piece of software lets you set up your computer as an airplay device and then you can ""cast"" to it with your ipad. It pops up a little screen on your computer that mirrors your ipad screen. Great for screen shares and OBS window captures.

,1611453242,l3pwqi,"Hey guys!

I've been playing cello for over 5 years now (and I'm just moving onto grade 6) but I still heavily rely on spots on the fingerboard to know where the notes are. I don't usually look at my left hand when playing unless I'm changing position which is happening more often now I'm getting to the higher grades.

Right now, I have spots for the first finger and fourth finger in first position and first finger in fouth position (for example on the A string that would be spots for B D and E). I used to have one for third finger first position but I got rid of it at the start of grade 5 because i found that i could use the fourth finger spot as reference for it whenever I was changing position.

I'm not very good at hearing notes (I can tell when a note is off but I find it hard to fix since i can never tell immediately if i'm sharp or flat) so I feel as if all hell will break loose if i get rid of the spots and am now left to guess where everything is.

I adore the Franck sonata, and it’s been in my list to tackle for a long time (I’ve played off and on with private study for ~14 years). When I listen to recordings of the last movement I’m hearing passages in different registers. 

Around the 4 minute mark [here ](https://music.apple.com/us/album/cello-sonata-in-a-major-fwv-8-iv-allegretto-poco-mosso/1483104300?i=1483104306): Capuçon takes the passage into a higher register, which I think is more accurate given the transcription from violin. Albeit, more difficult. 

But then [here ](https://music.apple.com/us/album/violin-sonata-in-major-fwv-8-arr-j-delsart-for-cello/1547476768?i=1547476774), Morris takes the passage down in register - which I can imagine is easier, but IMO creates balance issues and not my cup of tea tonally.

Is this an edition difference, and if so, can someone point me in the right direction as to which edition to purchase?",Cello,Franck sonata,,0

I think I'm a pretty advanced cellist, or at least was back when I practiced every day, but I could never figure out how to utilize my fingers in the bow hand. 

Does something like Colle for violins apply to cello too? I've asked some professional cellists throughout my career and they have mentioned the importance of bow hand finger flexibility  and control (especially in the pinky), but I could never see how it translated to practical playing  aside from fast technique like sautille or something. Either that, or maybe I'm utilizing it and just not aware of it.

I walk the cello for a couple of miles and back 2-3 times a month.

Right now I have one of those floppy bags that don't unzip all the way around. It bothers the pegs when I slide the cello in, and presses on the strings and the bridge once zipped up.

b) Today it detuned my A (again) and I finally broke it (yay, achievement unlocked) tuning it back up. :(

It was a surprise and no mistake. I over-tuned it, slowly, by less than a billionth of a nanohertz and it snapped. Could it have been the 20 minutes of cold while walking back from lesson?

The C also came loose by itself at some point, I noticed it just now when I gave it a sad strum walking past. Today sucks. :(((

The cello kept in tune, saving for the A once before, for about 7 months with no trouble at all. Is it the winter? Do I make the wife knit a woolly sock for the scroll? What gives?",Cello,Advice with cello case and string snapping,,0

,1611268474,l29kyl,"Our next meetup will be **this Saturday, again at 8 PM Scottish time (GMT).** For those that haven't joined before: **Our meetups are supposed to be fun and super-casual.** Those that want to play and share some of the music they are currently working on, are welcome to do so. Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

,1611250504,l239hl,"I joined orchestra in highschool and my dad bought a cello for me. Fast forward 5-6 years of no longer playing cello, and I'm thinking about selling it. I can't find any information on my cello, and I don't even know what skill level it's meant to be for. It's a 2001 Wm. Lewis and Son Impressario. It was made for Marshall Music Co in Lansing Michigan. I live all the way down in New Mexico, and couldn't get ahold of them. The closest thing I was able to find on the internet was a violin made by Lewis in 2001 with the same Impressario name. It was priced for $550 used on a instrument sales website, and said that it was made in China.  

Looking at the cello, I can tell that it's carved, inlayed, and I'm pretty sure all the fittings are Ebony. It has a Teller bridge, and 4 fine tuning knobs. It has a padded soft case, a Wm. Lewis and Son bow, and a $50 carbon fiber bow (my dad wasn't sure that the cello would come with a bow). My dad bought the cello used on ebay, and my cello teacher was quite impressed with the quality of cello that my dad had managed to buy online. I don't know if the cello came with the bridge and strings, or if we got them from the lady that we paid to set up the cello. The varnish does have some chips and scratches, with the worst damage being to one of the pointy bits coming off the side of the cello (forgive my very non technical jargon, it's been years since I've looked into luthery (or however you spell it)). The nut at the top of the finger board has a small crack in it that doesn't seem to go through and doesn't seem to affect the playability of the cello. 

Does anybody know anything about this make of cello or about how much it might be worth?  We might be able to take it to be appraised, but getting the scheduling to work might make it difficult.",Cello,Trying to figure out what grade my cello is.,,0

,1610673050,kxjk5x,"Our next meetup will be **this Saturday, again at 8 PM Scottish time (GMT).** For those that haven't joined before: **Our meetups are supposed to be fun and super-casual.** Those that want to play and share some of the music they are currently working on, are welcome to do so. Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

Student,1610426448,kvkjdo,"# Hello everyone! 

If you are feeling a bit unhappy with your recorded sound and you feel like your setup and equipment is all fine, try adding a touch of reverb! 

The trick is to find that sweet spot where the reverb makes your cello sound a bit fuller/rounder but doesn't make it sound unrealistically big or washed out. 

You can do this live or in post. I am sending my cello mic (AT pro35) to an effects petal (Zoom a1 four) where I have a few reverbs loaded up I have been playing with. However you could totally take your track and run it through your favorite DAW and add reverb there. 

If you are doing reverb post I would recommend sending tracks to a 100% wet reverb track and adjusting the reverb volume from there. This lets you blend the reverb in and makes it sound a bit more ""natural"".

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

my music background stopped after high school. i was a horn player and by senior year i could hit some grand notes, do vibrato, flutter-tonguing, and decent breath support. if i could have worked on anything in college it would be more mental stuff, mainly teaching myself that a flubbed note on stage is not the end of the world and i need to keep the ball rolling.

Benjamin Zander is a conducter who was teaching in a university for talented musicians and he observed, that the students had a problem: They were scared, scared to perform, scared to fail. And he asked himself what could he do to help. And this is what he did:

He said to his students all of them will get an A when they write him a letter ""Dear Mr. Zanders, I got my ""A"" because..."" addressed to themselves one year in the future but written in past tense . In this letter they should tell him as detailed as possible why they will have deserved the A not only from a musician point of view but especially from their own personal development. And the letters and reactions to it are all so touching. Just a little example:

*""Dear Mr Zander,*

*I got my A because I had the courage to examine my fears and I realized that they have no place in my life. (...) Thus all diffidence and lack of belief in myself are gone. So too is the belief that I only exist as a reflection in other people's eyes and the resulting desire to please everyone.... I understand that trying and achieving are the same thing when you are your own master - and I am.

I don't know what happened, but the last couple of months I get all cramped up from playing the cello.  4 years into playing, and I never had this problem until now.  My teacher is tutoring online due to Covid, so it's difficult for her to correct my posture at the moment.

,1610089136,ksxav2,"Right before making a big jump up the fingerboard, change the angle of your hand so that your fingers are pointing towards the direction you’re shifting. 

The mechanism behind this is simple. Normally, our fingers are about perpendicular to the fingerboard (your finger forms a 90 degree angle with the length of the fingerboard). If you tried to shift from this position, you’ll feel a lot of friction because a large, fleshy portion of your finger is rubbing against the fingerboard. This makes shifting harder than it needs to be.

By shifting the fingers closer to parallel with the fingerboard, your hand is in a much more natural position to fall down on its own. It also reduces friction because less of your fingertip is in contact with the fingerboard. 

This is a simple fix but it makes a big difference. Happy practicing!",Cello,Simple trick to improve your shifts,,0

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece.

I learnt cello with a teacher for six years (not anymore, that's why I'm asking here) and holding the bow has always been a problem for me. But right now it's to a point that I don't even want to play anymore.

Basically, if I play three minutes straight, I will have pain in the middle of the hand, my entire hand has a lot of tension and my thumb is extended, not curved. You could think that if I know what is wrong, I could just fix it, but that's the issue, I can't. My hand is contracting because I don't find any confortable position. I tried everything but nothing feels right. Just the simple fact of bending the thumb is not confortable because the ""edge"" of the bow where I put my thumb is too sharp, it's not painful but very unconfortable. I can't have a good grasp, it's like the bow slips between my fingers.

I just don't know what to do, I can't even play a basic piece without having this pain in the hand, even though I perfectly know how to hold the bow or how I'm supposed to place my fingers.",Cello,I can't hold the bow,,0
,1609864203,kr1sxx,"Hello all! New here. I've played cello since I was 6 nonstop until I was 17, was in orchestra and regular lessons. I was never *fantastic*, but I was definitely at a reasonable level of skill for someone that had been practicing for 10 years. The last performance pieces I remember working on were Kabalevsky's cello concerto no. 1 and the Paganini variations on one string.

Once I went to college, I didn't play much anymore, and not long after I pretty much stopped entirely. I'm 22 now and really want to get back to it: I can feel my cello staring at me reproachfully from the corner and it makes me feel guilty XD. Needless to say after 5 years without practice, I've lost a lot of my skills. I try to go back to my old performance pieces, even the ones from when I was 15-16 like Mendelssohn's 'song without words' or Faure's 'Elegie' but  even going all the way back to the Bhrams concerto it just sounds horrible. I tend to be very emotional and usually within 15-20 minutes I wind up in tears. The notes are (usually) in the right place but the piece has lost all its emotion. Even on my best days it sounds like a computer-generated piece, and on my bad days it sounds like a middle school recital. And then, inevitably, I get too ashamed of the terrible sound and put the cello back down and don't touch it for another couple weeks.

Of course I'm never going to get any better by not practicing, but how do returning players stop themselves from feeling too discouraged? I'm hoping that bringing in new pieces I've never played will help, because I won't have any expectation for how I should sound while playing them. Does anyone have any advice/recommendations? I'd say in terms of level I'm probably down to around suzuki 3 or 4.",Cello,Returning Player Blues... send help,,0

I am a cello beginner - one year in - and practice about an hour on most days of the week. Sometimes longer, sometimes less.

I hope this is not a dumb question. I don’t know many cellists besides myself, and the other day while I was watching a YouTube video, the musician suggested that one of the best ways to improve is what is apparently called mentorship/apprenticeship program, also known as good old practicing regularly with a more advanced cellist.

My question is also, what do mentors get from taking you under their wing and playing with you from time to time? Do you pay a mentor in the same way you pay for a private teacher, or what do they actually get from playing with someone less advanced than them? I can’t see why people should do that unless there is a monetary compensation, but maybe I am being too nihilistic and some other things come into play like the sheer joy of mentoring someone, friendship, similar way of thinking, etc.

I thought I would ask the questions here, I believe you guys know the answers. 

In no particular order: 

1. Are 2cellos very well known in the Cello community?
2. Do they cheat, or are all the Cello sounds they produce genuinely from Cellos? Sure I understand they have amplification and use some percussion instruments, and I believe some of their songs also feature an electric guitar. 
3. 2set used to have me thinking that the violin was at the top end of the spectrum of musical instruments. And it is, but after listening to 2Cellos I'm starting to wonder why. Seems to me the Cello is a more than capable solo instrument, and has the range to perform such a wide variety of roles. Seems to me as a classical guitarist that the Cello is a much deeper broader and more universal instrument, is this correct? Why then does the violin still keep getting all the solo parts? 
4. I have to also say that Segovia was wrong. I have great respect for the man, the so called grandfather of my instrument, but to me personally I see the Cello as the most expressive instrument, or maybe I'm just wrong but 2cellos certainly showcase this.

If you would like to maximize your learning experience, you can open Discord on your computer or phone, and enter one of the voice channels, which would allow everyone who enters - to hear you practice :\] At the end of the month, there will be a recital to perform the piece(s) you have learned (which is optional but highly encouraged :). We also have monthly events celebrating composers, such as Vivaldi's 230th death anniversary on July 28th. In addition, as you progress with your piece(s), you can make a recording and post it in #recordings channel for others to listen to (if they missed you in a practice room), but this is also optional. 

**Listeners:** If you love music, you can join as well! You will have the function to chat and motivate others. Maybe we'll motivate you to start learning an instrument!

The sound pole held for a few minutes and I thought all would be well but it fell.

I’m just wondering if it’s structurally bad to let it sit like this for a few days?

The soonest because of holiday I’d be able to get to a luthier is Monday... and even then I’m not sure if that’s an option... I live in LA and everything is heavily Covid affected. 

And... I have a placeholder bridge from a bad electric cello... should I could I prop it up myself at least temporarily? Do I need the special tool or is there another trick?

(The bridge snapped because it was warped forward like a wave ever so slightly. Has never happened in my 25 years of playing, with much worse warping! That said I feel like I need to understand how to preempt bridge warp as well... sigh...)

Looking through the Schroeder 170 Etudes, I have a question about the W.B. (Whole Bow) indication. Does this mean each single note has to be played with the whole length of the bow? Even quarter or eighth notes? Or maybe it simply means that the note can be started at any point of the bow?  In the second case, L.H. (Lower Half) and U.H. (Upper Half) would seem to indicate that each note may be played anywhere in lower/upper half of the bow.

First I wanna say that I'm not really a complete beginner, as I already have years of experiment with other instruments, and intend to self learn to play cello as a hobby. There are somethings that I'm not sure about this instrument yet and would love to hear from mature players :)

\- How good should my intonation be? How accurate (how many cents deviated from true notes) can decent cellists play, in lower as well as higher positions? As mentioned I have much experience in music and hence good sense of pitch. In 1st and 2nd position, if given time, I can generally grope for notes that are about 10 cents apart from correct notes, but can never touch the right spot right away. I would like to know an average skill so that I can set a goal for practicing.

\- I usually position my bow right in the middle between the bridge and the bottom of the fingerboard. However I noticed that when playing in ≥ 5th positions, the D and G string would be pressed down an angle so large, that the spots where my bow touches them would lie almost flat or even below the neighboring strings, making the bow impossible to reach. Does that mean my bridge is too high or not curved enough or my bow is in wrong place?

So, I'm relatively newish to Cello, but not to playing music in general, and I play a handful of other instruments. I'm getting the hang of it fairly well, and I do have a teacher I meet with every other week. The only *really frustrating* problem I'm having is the A string sounds like garbage when I switch bow direction on it. It's a rented cello, but it's a high quality one that my instructor is happy with - the place that rents it out is from a woman who makes/repairs/is a master cellist, so she only keeps high quality instruments.

All the other strings I can make good sound with - my instructor is happy with (and surprised by) my progress. I can do decent string changes and all that, and for the most part have no squeaks  - but not with the damn A string. 

I've tried all the usual fixes - More rosin, less rosin, cleaning strings, harder/softer bow pressure, tilting the bow, more flat bow, etcetc... I'll sit and just bow back and forth and right when I think I've got it it goes to garbage again. I don't have this issue on any other string.

Is there a secret trick to this that I'm not getting? It seems like it's usually only the first little bit of sound when I switch direction and then it evens out and sounds ok even though I can't tell that I'm doing anything different.

,1609122234,klh5ex,"Hello! After reading about many different experiences and advice I decided to purchase a Yamaha SCV-110SK silent electric cello. It gets here this week and I am so excited! I learned on a traditional acoustic cello and played for close to ten years so I do have a pretty solid foundation already. I chose the electric because I live in an apartment and need to be able to practice quietly. I like that this model has a frame that mimics the acoustic body and the reviews I've read/seen for it have been great.

My question is in regards to amps. I will not be playing with the goal to perform, at least not for a long while. This is purely for myself as a hobby (and since I am picking it back up after a long absence I'll be far from performing standards anyway). But if I did want to play a song for a friend or something, what would be the best amp option? I don't want anything super loud, just enough to project a nice clear sound. I have never owned an electric instrument so I am new to the world of amps. Have no idea where to start.

My ideal would be something small, not overly loud, and uncomplicated to set up. I would like a classical sound and style as close to authentic acoustic as possible. Does anyone have any suggestions or advice? I'd love to hear from fellow apartment dwellers in particular... how has that worked out for you and what's your set up?

So for a bit of background, I’m high school student, and I teach cello lessons. I have four students right now, which is a good amount to me. None of them were absolute beginners—they’d all started learning in their school orchestra (just like how I started almost 6 years ago). Their ages are 11-14. 
I’m content with the amount of students I currently have. Along with teaching lessons, I work about 20 hours a week, and I teach a morning strings class before school every day.

Obvious answer might be „then don’t use them, duh“ but like I said, they’re a gift and so I’d like to put them to use out of respect for my husband who gave them to me. 

Are there any solutions to this problem? Maybe different pegs? My cello has guitar-like pegs. I looked into double bass-like pegs, would that be a good idea? Are there „knob pegs“ or something? Can I remove the handle when I’m not tuning? Something?

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece.
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM BST**. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

,1608782858,kj8eia,"Hey there, cello folks. 

I picked up the violin close to a year ago and have kept with it daily and made good progress. I told myself I’d wait at least a year before picking up another instrument to learn. 

The time will be here in a couple months. 

I have really been wanting to play cello since it can go so much lower than the violin. 

So, my questions...

1. Is 1k enough for an “ok” instrument that will last a few years? I know with violins there is a lot of variation in quality. Are cellos similar?

2. Will the rosin for my violin work for the cello bow? 

3. I have a decent violin bow I invested in for the long term. I know nothing of fellow bows. Is there as large a gap in quality between bow types as there is with violin? 

4. Not really a major question but...are the bowing techniques the same or similar? I know the weight of the bow isn’t really on the string the same way it is with violin but does that make as big a difference as I think?

5. I have a violin teacher. I am not rich. I will consider a cello teacher if I invest in a cello. I would never try to teach myself violin, it’s just not a good thing to do. Is cello more or less self teaching friendly?

6. I’ll visit my luthier, I don’t know what to look for in cellos. What are some things I should look at and be aware of when trying them out? I plan on asking if renting is an option also.",Cello,Beginner questions,,0

,1608649019,ki6up8,"Hi cellists,

I'm trying to see if any of you might remember or saved a video posted a few years ago where a young cellist was explaining a technique to play artificial harmonics in thumb position whilst keeping the 'normal' fingerings. 

I vaguely remember it had something to do with leaving behind some fingers and you could get the full scale as harmonics without jumping octaves whilst fingering as you would normally. It was one of my first saved posts before finding out that reddit just deletes the old ones as you accumulate more.

Back then I hadn't even started to look at thumb position and was way out of my reach but would love to give it a go for the next couple of Christmas lockdown weeks.

Hope you are all keeping safe and hopefully someone might remember can find it.

So I'm learning this peice for my next solo and using it for some really important auditions. I've been looking around on YouTube and see an insane amount of young people playing the peice and doing pretty good 

Now I'm not new to the cello so I know that no matter what piece, theres always gonna be prodigies who play at young ages 😂. But I still feel for this peice in particular there is an insane amount of younger people playing it. For perspective, I'm 14, and I'm seeing 10,11, and 12 yo/s conquer the search results.

As in, C5 gives me a feeling of C6 on a violin. 

Similarly, I really enjoy playing on C and G strings first position but on recordings of other cellists they sound much lower and more bass to me then when I actually play them myself. Is it a similar effect to our own voice sounding very different to us when we hear ourselves speaking compared to when we hear ourselves in recording?

,1608537729,khcy7i,"So here is my situation:
I am practicing cello for 2 years now. I am learning from a teacher at my local music school. As I started he recommended a small local business who sells, repairs, builds and rents Cellos. I am renting a Cello (including softcase and bow) from this place for 240€/6 months. The contract says the value of the Cello is 3600€. It also says 4/4 and “romanian”. I don’t know anything else about this Cello. I guess he built it by himself out of wood from Romania?

After dipping my toe into the joy of playing cello for two years I can say that I like it and I want to continue playing as a hobby (nothing crazy, just for myself or in an amateur orchestra when I am good enough).
Now I did the math and it seems like financially it would be a good idea to stop paying monthly rent and buy a cello.

I only played on the cello I am renting right now and I am not skilled or confident enough to go to a store and test some cellos.
Since I am still a beginner I wouldn’t know what to look for in a cello. I like the one I am renting but have no comparison at all.

There was never a problem with the cello I am renting for now but I guess a cello needs a check up as any other instrument which is regularly played. Cost for repair is included in the rent right now. What are the things which need regular care / repair (I guess strings an bow hair) and how much does it normally cost?
Do people rent a cello for long term or is renting recommended for beginners who are not sure about if they like the cello (I am past that point)? When is a good time to have an opinion on “is this a good cello for me”? Do I have to think about different bows as well?

I guess the overall question is: should I buy a cello?

,1608483369,kgxgt0,"I am pretty much a beginner; I noticed my A peg keeps slipping and every time I go to play the cello it has slipped significantly out of place.   I just had my A string replaced yesterday in the shop, and they tuned it for me.   When I went to play today it had slipped so it was playing a G.  I tightened the bridge tuner as much as I could and it was still barely an A flat.    Then I tried very slowly tightening the peg and it immediately snapped the string again.

What did I do wrong?   Is it possible the bridge is out of place causing more tension on the string than needed?  I remember the bridge fell out a while back and I tried placing it back myself, and since then the A string immediately breaks every time I try to tighten the peg even a smidge.   And yes it keeps slipping every time which is very annoying.  Even at the shop they were having problems with this.

Should I just go get a complete tune-up and have them fix the bridge and restring everything? Can something be done to stop the peg from slipping?

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student. If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :)

Note that I will also be happy to continue hosting these meetings on a weekly basis as long as there is interest in them. I will always make a new post each week and add in the zoom details the day of the meeting. Time and day of the week will always be the same though.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece.
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM BST**. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

Music instrument performing can be complex since it requires complicated and asymmetrical motions of both hands, which need good muscle coordination to complete. To grasp all these motions, music instrument learners are supposed to practice for a lot of times in a long term.

For young music learners, they may need more supervision in daily practice. When they are taking music lessons, teachers can play the role of supervisors. But when lessons end, teachers are not likely to follow up students’ practice 24/7. Therefore, parents are ideal ones to take up the baton and help their children’s practice after music lessons.

https://preview.redd.it/azgq3kq51i561.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0205b32e7b9f0c3d6a6f337374c7ca7d278d713c

**So what should parents do to be helpful after music instrument lessons?**

First of all, music parents need to keep in mind that their company is aimed at **helping children improve practicing efficiency and enjoy the process**, rather than watching whether their children have practiced.

# Treat Practicing after Music Lessons Like Relaxation

There are academic classes for children, there should be after-school activities as well. Taking various classes, such as Math, PE, Science, etc, is the daily routine. Then after school, they are likely to be faced with piles of endless homework.

With so many different subjects, it is no wonder that setting a time slot to practice music instrument can seem like a burden to a kid. Therefore, music parents need to help their children see playing music in a different light.

Rather than treating practicing like any other subject, parents need to create a distinction so that children see violin practice as relaxation. The best way to shift children’s mindset is to let them play music which they are actually interested in.

# Let Children Play Music They Like

While there are always certain signature songs and classics for violin, or for piano, or for any music instrument, children may lose interest if he or she does not like the music/music instrument they are playing. Parents can try to work with their children’s teacher to make sure that their children have the chance to learn and play some music they truly enjoy.

According to the Academy of Music and Dance, “As children get to be around 10 years old, sometimes younger, they start to develop preferences for musical style, which is largely influenced by internet, radio, TV, and whatever they are most exposed to at home. They will also typically gravitate to whatever their friends are listening to.”

Parents can use this as a motivational strategy and allow their children to play at least one song they like as part of their weekly routine. Classic repertories are also essential, but performing other songs the children enjoy can work as an impetus for daily practicing.

https://preview.redd.it/6omaizm22i561.png?width=509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c47e70c8579c6efaeb43dc5aeace03b9bab259a

# Make Music Practice after Lessons Fun

This should come as no surprise. No one wants to practice when it is boring. Incorporate fun games, activities, and challenges can make young music instrument learners look forward to practicing.

In fact, very few children are self-motivated in their daily practice. Most need incentives and reminders to keep them focused and moving forward. Parents may also communicate with the music teachers and develop some creative ways making practice more fun.

# Form A Practice Schedule and Create Challenges

To form a schedule or a to-do list can help people avoid procrastination in some way. Parents may let their children determine the practice schedule. In this way, children are more likely to stick to it.

Children hear parents tell them what to do all the time. To catch their attention, letting them plan their own practice schedule can be effective. Besides, it really improves their strategic thinking in a long term.

Basically, parents can get their children to determine when to practice, what to practice, and how long to practice. After the decision is made, parents can help children research and figure out how often a good musician practices. The children then can set a schedule based on the reality that one must practice more to become excellent. Not only will this allow children to feel a sense of control, it will also help them learn the value of practice.

Besides, parents can help children set specific goals and challenges. This will help them progress faster because they will work on accomplishing specific tasks or mastering particular skills. Don’t just ask kids to ‘practice’. Instead, parents may give them bite-sized and clear challenges to complete. For example, set a goal like working out a fingering for measures 24–35, or gradually speeding up section B to 85 bpm.

# Be Children’s Cheerleader and Celebrate All Accomplishments They Made under the Music Teachers’ Guidance

Parents should let children know that they always had their parents as the biggest fans, especially when they may feel frustrated or discouraged.

Parents are supposed to listen to their children at home as often as possible and make encouraging remarks about children’s progress. Also, parents should make sure to ask their young learners how the music lessons went. Once parents take a genuine interest in their children’s musical journey, the young musicians will be excited to play.

Moreover, parents need to celebrate their children’s little victories along the way of violin learning. Learning to play the violin is a long journey full of peaks, valleys, and plateaus. Celebrating the little victories will help children keep a positive attitude when they are struggling or having difficulty tackling a new concept or song.

While verbal praise and giving some rewards are important, parents may also find another way to celebrate achievements. Keeping a journal of children’s accomplishments can be a good way. When parents put it in writing, they are less likely to forget.

# Plan Performances for Children

When it comes to music instrument learning, we all know that it is important to keep the little performers engaged and excited about their music education. Giving them the chance to perform consistently throughout the year can definitely hit the mark. Consistent performances continue to motivate children. Scheduled performances on campus, instrument performing competitions and other occasions all work well.

By planning performances for children and encouraging them to be on stage, parents can help children increase excitement and confidence. Besides, it may make children themselves recognize that more practice means avoiding embarrassment at a recital.

https://preview.redd.it/bohtzy2o3i561.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9db91554cc17bc93d74b7a8b5bc3c40c55d9c83c

# Help Children Engage with Music and Understand the Gift of Music

Children are more likely to practice music if they feel connected to the process. Parents need to help their young learners develop an interest and curiosity for music. Once children find themselves are engaged with music, they are more likely to be willing to practice.

Besides, parents should be engaged with music themselves. They can create a musical atmosphere at home by showing interest to music, for example, listening to music and sing together. In this way, children may naturally want to imitate their parents, so it is a big motivation for children to practice.

What’s more, parents should take efforts to confirm children that playing the music instrument is an opportunity that is not necessarily available to everyone. They need to teach children to appreciate music and what music can offer and help them discover that music can enhance their life. To make children understand the gift of music, parents can take them to concerts or shows, play music at home, and help them discover what they like. This can also help children understand why practicing after music lessons is important.

Different parents may have various ways to help their children’s daily practice. All the ways are aimed at providing children with effective practice and also a chance to make achievements. The whole process requires all parents’ participation and efforts.

My old set was still in pretty good condition, but I figured that it was a good opportunity to get a few sets of strings and do some testing. My brother's cello settled into its new strings decently well, but my cello seems to not like the new setup, and I'm wondering if it's common for cellos to ""reject"" strings.

My old set on my cello felt both rich and mellow, and was pretty balanced in tone, tension, and projection. However, my new set is markedly different. The Jargar Superiors are punchier and project more than the last set, but the Thomastiks feel at least three times louder than my old GCs and maybe around two times louder than the Jargars.

And therein lies the problem. The Thomastiks are **so** resonant that my cello actually shakes and buzzes when I play on the G string, and I can't figure out where it's coming from. From a purely tonal perspective, I don't dislike the changes. The new tones are pretty interesting and fun to play with if I'm gentle, but I also recognize that the sound balance for my cello is totally off and I'm thinking of switching back to the old set.

I had my cello checked by a luthier earlier this year, and he said that it was in good condition. I'm also not dying to play on these strings, even if I like their sound, so it might be overkill going back to have the luthier adjust my cello just for the new strings (especially since I quite liked my old set). Does anyone have any thoughts on this? My cello isn't cheap, it was bought from Hammond Ashley in the 5k range, but now I'm wondering if there might have been something intrinsically wrong with it that the old strings were masking.",Cello,Variation on (Resonant) Strings,,0
Student,1608011449,kdfyj0,"# Hello my name is Morgan Little, I play the baroque cello.

I also play the cello. But I am playing a baroque cello in this video. Cool. Here is a tutorial on how to play baroque cello, and how to play continuo.   

# [Here is the video](https://youtu.be/Titv2owk_bw)

In this episode of let's talk continuo, I use my baroque cello to play a selection from Telemann's singe spiel und generalbaßübungen called ""Happiness"". Hey, we all could use some more happiness these days so thank you Telemann for the wonderful suggestion. This selection has a lot of opportunity for embellishment and I take a little risk by embellishing and realizing the figured bass live. Or whatever live means these days.   As is always, there are so many ways to play music on the baroque cello. Please use this as a guide on how to play the baroque cello my way, and then take some time and experiment with your own sounds and ideas. After all thats what playing the cello is all about.

,1607996897,kdc0lv,"Hello; new to this community. I grew up playing the cello, all through grade school and into college. Then college sucked the life out of me but I'm finally picking up the cello again after several years. I'm using a newer cello that is not what I'm used to playing. I am pretty sure it's entry-level in price.

All the strings have a different sound quality. The A string is bright and crisp. The D string is still crispy, but has a muddier tone. The G and C strings are even muddier.

I'm attmepting to mimic a professional recording of some favorite numbers, and it's hard for me to audibly tell when they go to different strings. Yet when I play, the difference between strings is obvious, and detracts from the purity of the cello's song.

What does this mean? Is my technique bad? Are my strings just crummy? Or is it the whole instrument? What can I do to improve and unify the tone quality across strings?

Thanks for any advice!",Cello,"Each string's tone has a different quality, but I can't tell in professional recordings",,0

,1607856869,kc8p0c,"Hi guys - I am interested in your thoughts about the relative merits of sticking with a good teacher with whom the student has a good relationship and attendance at a junior conservatoire weekend programme. The Junior Programmes offer what seems like a really good opportunity to play in groups, to sing in a choir, to receive training on musicality and to make friends with peers who share their passion for music, but it means giving up their existing instrumental music teachers. 

My instinct for the moment is probably to keep him with his current teachers as he really likes them and they seem to be getting great results, and perhaps look at things again when the auditions come around again in Spring 2022 (for admission in September 2022). The counter-argument is that because of the rate of his progress, perhaps waiting until Sep 22 is too long. Obviously I wouldn't encourage him to audition without discussing it with his teachers first and seeking their advice (they all studied at conservatoires - not sure whether at this young age), but because I am not a musician myself I don't have a good understanding of what these junior programmes are really like.",Cello,Private tuition vs Junior Conservatoire for Young Players,,0

,1607836693,kc4w7k,"I've been struggling with this internal debate for the better part of a year, whether to keep my cello around. Through various differing opinions from mentors and friends, I've decided to reach out to seek other opinions. I apologize in advance if any of my explanation sounds arrogant or aloof, I just would like to illustrate some of the external factors in my reasoning.

To keep a long story short, I (19M, graduated 2019) have been playing since the 5th grade (9). To give a sense of the local politics, there were two districts with string programs, with one being much more highly regarded than the other (All-State orchestra line-ups rarely included the one district but the other was shoe-ins). 

In high school, I was respected as one of the better youth cellists in the community, being placed best in class at one district (seniority/skill based seating, in that order) and 3rd chair in the other (raw skill). I played in several trios and quartets, each with their own relative respect, including pairings of students from both districts. I was one of the few that jumped the divide between the two districts through extracurricular music activities, and made many good friends. 

The summer after my sophomore year, I had been personally invited to fill in for a music festival/summer intensive. While it was an outstanding experience, and one I'd like to do again, I solidified my decision not to pursue music beyond a recreational love. I could not devote my life in that manner, the stress seemed just to much to bear. I still loved the camaraderie and connection I had playing recreationally.

My junior year was nothing spectacular, until our district was selected to play at the state music educators conference, where I would be a featured member of a concertina in performance of a concerto grosso.

Eventually, after some flukes, I ended up transferring to the other district for my senior year, therefore forfeiting my seat in the aforementioned conference.

That year, for many reasons, was probably the lowest point of my short time on this rock, but I still had music. I had music through family deaths, alienation of friends, breakups, school transfers, debilitating migraines that resembled strokes, everything. Through everything, my cello stood by my side.

This school has a competition for senior performances, to cut down on program times. The night before, as I'm working on some passages of Kabalevsky 1, I need to take out some trash. I slip and break my wrist. As rehearsals continue as my fracture heals, I realize that I had a near certain chance of being selected. Because of that, and the other previous history, I mentally threw in the towel. I finished the year, graduated, and have since touched my cello 3 times. Each time, I can't help but have this bitter mindset regarding playing. Hence, the thought has crossed my mind, ""should I sell my cello?""

I can't bring myself to any definitive answer, as they have pros and cons. On one hand, this object that once was the joy and pride of my life has now turned into this dark cloud. But on the other, I give myself the opportunity to reframe the experiences on my own terms, without having to later find a cello.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student. If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :)

Note that I will also be happy to continue hosting these meetings on a weekly basis as long as there is interest in them. I will always make a new post each week and add in the zoom details the day of the meeting. Time and day of the week will always be the same though.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece.
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM BST**. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

He is currently playing a standard beginner cello borrowed from school. It is fine (at least since I replaced the strings), but I am vaguely thinking about buying him his own cello as he clearly isn't going to give it up any time soon, and given the rate of his progress I am not going to be hanging on for him to grow into a 7/8 or 4/4 size cello (he is 8 and really quite small compared to peers, so I am guessing we have at least 4 years at 3/4 size).

,1607322113,k8b9az,"Here's part of a blog post I wrote on this subject:

**The question of size:** 

Should an adult choose a smaller cello?

I have a 1/10 size cello at home for a young grandchild. It’s still a bit large for her. Can you imagine if I gave her a full size (4/4) cello to play? That would be ridiculous! She couldn’t hold it between her knees, she couldn’t reach down to use the bow correctly, and she certainly couldn’t play it in tune because her hands are tiny. Sitting at the piano, her hand span is about four white keys. Most adults’ piano handspan would be between 9 and 11 white keys.

Stringed instruments are made in different sizes because not all people are the same. We know that children are given smaller cellos, violins, violas or basses. Why not do the same for adults? 

* What are the secret herbs and spices used in choosing the correct size for an adult? 
* Shouldn’t adults just play a grown-up (full-size) cello?
* If I play a smaller cello am I diminished as a musician somehow, like being given a child’s toy?
* Will a smaller cello sound worse or less than a “normal” one? 
* How small is too small? 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The year I turned 13, on my teacher’s advice I was given my first full-size cello. I was so proud of it. It supported my musical growth very nicely for the next 5 years until my last teacher advised us to upgrade prior to leaving school, studying cello at college and pursuing my musical career. As a young professional I found certain aspects of my technique very difficult and although it didn’t stop me working and teaching, I was always a little frustrated with how hard I found some specific passages of music when others seemed to breeze through them. 

Around three decades later I left my teaching job to work in a music store and guess what I discovered? There is a wonderful array of smaller options I’d never encountered. Another decade passed and I took the plunge down to a seven-eighth size cello. My hand is so much happier and I can actually master some of those pesky passages that previously eluded me … 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*As a teacher it didn’t even cross my mind to suggest smaller players might need a smaller cello. In line with the general approach of most teachers, when they reached high school we moved them to full size. 

One of our regular patrons is a lovely lady with the most gorgeous half-size cello that is exactly the right size for her. When our workshop has given it a new bridge or done other work it is a real joy to test this beautiful small cello before calling to say it’s ready. 

How do I decide the correct size for someone? 

There are four main factors I need to consider: 

* **Body height**. Does the cello fit in terms of body height? At 172cm I can easily cope with a 4/4 cello, but my fingers are a bit short. Somebody who is 155cm will always struggle with full size.
* **Body shape**. Remember that we have to grip the cello lightly with our knees/calves and lean it comfortably against the chest, with the scroll just behind our right ear. Sometimes we might choose a different size OR different body design: Strad is slimmer, Montagnana is wider. I’ve chosen a 7/8 Montagnana because I needed a slightly shorter fingerboard to accommodate my shorter fingers, but the fatter cello felt more comfortable. It also sounds wonderful!
* **Arm length**. Maybe your body can cope with a certain size, but if your arms are shorter perhaps the next size down would help. Remember, at some stage you will be playing the full length of the fingerboard, and need to be able to maintain correct handshape and elbow position. 
* **Hand size/finger length**. To me, this is the most important factor by far. If your fingers can’t fairly naturally fall into reasonably good semitones in first position, then you will struggle in much of your playing. You need to be able to play in extended position, and to keep good handshape in thumb position. The wrong size cello will hurt your hands and may well give you RSI or similar.

When my (now nearly 29) teenage daughter moved schools in Year 10 and needed her own cello, I bought a 4/4 one which sounded lovely but was always too large. She would occasionally complain about pain and ask me to tell her teacher to ease off on making her stretch for notes that she couldn’t reach. I still didn’t understand. Many years later this same daughter came to our shop for a 7/8 and we found even that was much too large, so she purchased a very nice 3/4 size cello which suited her just right. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**The question of pain** is an interesting one: 

I’ve spent much of the last decade consulting frequently with an excellent musculoskeletal doctor because of various issues associated with being an cellist and enthusiastic young man who didn’t always lift things within his limits (or do it correctly!) despite warnings from those who were older and wiser. Now that I'm getting older I have developed a keen interest in understanding how my body works when I play the cello.

There have been times when adult learners have visited our shop, or we’ve met at one of our trade displays, and conversation has found its way to the pain in their hands, shoulders or back. When I have then tried them on our cellos we have found two big factors which seem to contribute to the problem: posture, especially relating to shoulder and elbow positioning; and cello size, which first affects our ability to form the ideal hand shape and position when playing, and second, affects our posture and compounds the whole thing! Finding the most appropriate size can be a lifesaver indeed.

In a couple of cases these lovely, eager cellists have developed something similar to “trigger finger” or “trigger thumb”. Their cellos were full-size and they had ended up in so much pain they had stopped playing for long periods of time. We have looked at posture, changed to smaller cellos, given some appropriate hand exercises, and in one case sent our friend to see a good hand O.T.; and now they are happily playing again with much better results. One of these two ladies moved to 7/8  and the other now has a 3/4  cello. Finding the right size, and working with posture/technique, made all the difference. And once upon a time I, like most other cello teachers, would have continued to inflict 4/4 pain on them until they eventually gave up because just looking at a cello would induce a nasty sensation … 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The question of sound: 

Choosing a smaller instrument will reduce the sound a little, but it doesn’t have to be a problem. Plenty of young children reach a very high standard while still playing on 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 cellos, completing all the exam grades and even progressing to the diploma levels. For this reason, there are also plenty of smaller cellos made to meet the quality requirements associated. 

7/8 and 3/4 size cellos:

Most adults with smaller hands will require a 7/8 cello. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Here's a link to my original article. I know most people reading this are not in Australia so the various models I recommend won't apply to you, however there is a great brand of cellos made in USA called Jay Haide, and their 7/8 are awesome. Presumably there would be a range from Scott Cao as well. I play a Jay Haide Montagnana 7/8.

Have been practicing since I got my cello in September and wanted to share a recording I made today of me playing The Elephant. I know I sound like trash but I played it from memory, 😁 which is something I never did as a child. My string transitions are not that awful here as some of the times I play either.

https://sndup.net/7fjq

I love my cello, it's great. I got a Stentor student II model coz it has the ebony fingerboard and got some Pro Arte strings for cheap. They are old stock and I'm worried they may break easily so I'm careful about tuning. Sound 10 times better than the strings it came with. In the new year I plan to take it to a luthier to have someone set it up professionally but for now it can make pretty enough sounds (not so much by me). The girl at the music shop thinks that the Stentor cellos come set up and ready to play from their factory in China, so putting that theory to test I'm trying to break it in a bit as is. After Christmas when I have more money I will get it set up properly though and have a new bridge installed. 

Had one lesson in last week of September a few days after putting a fingertape decal thing (it's off now) on my cello. Was fun and I learnt stuff but they were not interested in providing ongoing lessons to me. Obviously I was a bit disappointed and felt bad but the way they played vibrato made it sound like the cello was dying (I didn't share that) so upon reflection maybe it's not so bad. Total waste of sixty bucks and I wish I'd spent the money on sheet music 😜

In primary school my teacher used the all for strings books and I remember going through all three but no longer have the ability to play all the music now. I stopped playing in high school, I think probably because I missed my teacher and other reasons. High school I went to the Piatti method (book 2), but I mustn't have studied it well because I'm doing book 1 now and already playing differently to how I was taught. It has been a lot of fun but there is a lot of practice. I never practiced as a child and was so uninterested with the sounds the instrument makes and the music I could play. The last music I remember studying at about 13-4 was Summertime and etudes from Piatti book 2. That was 22-3 years ago so that's why I sound like trash now...

Sorry for the huge amount of writing but I just wanted to pre-empt the whole get yr cello set up by a violin-family luthier and the get a teacher advice. In the new year I plan to seek lessons. Book 1 seems very manageable by myself if my skill improves over the next few months though. I'm revising a lot of the info in the all for strings books too. The yellow pages of book 1 made me feel very nostalgic ☺️ I don't like much of the music in those books however and prefer the etudes in the Piatti books. Is anyone familiar with the new school of cello by Percy Such and if that would be complimentary to what I'm doing? What should my learning pathway be? I printed the Dotzauer violoncelllo-schule but i don't like the finger markings, it doesn't look fun 😬 I asked the nice gentleman at the music shop some of this stuff but he told me that all the method books are the same and that the difference is the instruction given by the teacher.

1. Haydn Cello Concerto 1st movement in C Major 
- There’s a lot of mixed 32nd notes here and I’m really messed up and confused by them. I’ve come through a lot of different recordings on this piece from YouTube and I already know how the piece flows. But I don’t know how to count he rhythm easily in the simplest way. I do know 32nd notes mean 8 notes per beat but I don’t know how to combine all these mixed notes together. So I would like to know how you guys deal with counting these complicated rhythm when working on Haydn Concerto. I’ve heard a method that suggest to double up the rhythm, like make 32nd notes into 16th notes and 16th becomes 8th notes etc. And once u get used to it double up the tempo. But if I do it like that, I think I would never know how to count mixed or complicated 32nd notes ever. Can anybody tell me the simplest yet understandable way to count these rhythm?

2. Bach Prelude Suite 1
- I have some problems with crossing strings and pressing two notes simultaneously with the same fingering ( like B at A string and G at D strings) 
- I want to achieve a ringing clear sound when crossing strings especially from bar 31 until 35 where you have to constant cross between A and D string. 
- I would also like to know how to achieve a nice clear tone when playing many notes in a bow 
- From bar 39 to 41, when we are required to press notes prior on two strings. I feel like my pinky is straining. I have quite long but slim fingers. Any solutions for slim fingers cellists to avoid strained pinky?
- At bar 4 where we are required to press B on A string and G on D strings. I feel like there are squeaking sound when I cross strings and the same problem comes - my pinky will get a lil flat and I don’t think it’s good since I wasn’t told to have a C shape left hand shape since I start
- there’s some bars where I need to press two strings together (like E on D string and B on A string) . But it results that my first finger is flat and can’t produce a clear and rich sound. 

3. Tarantella by W.H Squire
- there are some double stops where some of them need to press notes and play D string simultaneously. I find it hard to achieve a clear sound too. Do I have to constantly change the angle slightly to play double stops?
- Same question on here is that how to play many notes that are slurred together in one bow ?

It seems risky to buy a cello online without trying it first. But I live in Switzerland and proper cellos at luthier shops here are so expensive! I'm not saying they are not worth it and I'm sure they are lovely, but they are very much out of my league - such an instrument would be wasted on me.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached.

Note that I will also be happy to continue hosting these meetings on a weekly basis as long as there is interest in them. I will always make a new post each week and add in the zoom details the day of the meeting. Time and day of the week will always be the same though.

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where **mistakes are allowed**.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece.
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM BST**. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.

,1606344668,k12y25,"Hi, guys?
I'm 26 year old Canada immigrant, playing Viola at university.
I'm currently attending to the university in Vancouver as graduate student and just finished first term of first year.
I actually started learning viola very late, maybe at 20 or something, so it's been about 6 years since i started. I like playing viola, but I actually never practiced desperately or never spent like 6~8 hours for practicing in my life. I think the longest hours were like 4 or 5 hours, but average is 2~3 hours. Yet, i've been improving quite fast. Somehow, i finished my Bachelor degree and performance degree program at pretty popular music academy in Vancouver and currently attending to university as graduate student. Borrowing the words of my former and current professors, i have a great musicality and fast learning talent.

So, what i want to ask about? 
I'm just feeling like i'm on the edge of a breakdown. I just don't know what i should do after finishing my master degree program. I don't speak english fluently and never have any experience at teaching viola in English. What kind of parents would ask me to teach? Taking audition for professional orchestra? Yeah.. they won't take me. As i wrote above, i only have musicality as my talent. Most of Orchestra wants technique over musicality. I'm not trying to become a soloist or chamber musicians who are demanded to be musically talented. It is different story for orchestra players. Some of you may deny this fact, but it is truth that orchestra employers will look your technique over musicality. They want someone who can play every single notes accurately in tune over someone who play beautifully with messy tune. Also, there are too less chance to take an audition. I mean, do i have to wait until some old violist in orchestra retired or die to take an audition?

fairly recently I have started to self-teach some cello so that we/I can have some chamber music under corona conditions with the available friends. We form a quartet, but the others are, obviously, way beyond my level (we've played the Schubert octet together, with me on horn; both violins can do the first part in that, and the viola is almost on their level while considering the piano his primary instrument).

We've recently played Mozart's Divertimento No 1, KV 136, and they've been endlessly patient while I battle bow and stops into submission in this objectively really technically easy piece and said they rather enjoyed having the time to do the music justice while, for once, their cello did not complain about being bored.

Now the questions - are there other pieces in a similar vein, maybe a tad more difficult/involved, where the higher parts are not bored to tears yet I may still be able to carry my share? Ideally in a friendly key and with minimal, if any, shifting? Maybe even with the occasional empty string (do you call unstopped strings empty?) so I have a moment to compose myself, rest the left hand and acquire a new point of reference?

,1606159125,jzoba9,"Hi, all. When I was 10 or 11 and an intense cello player, I got [my cello](https://imgur.com/CGvIjBS), my first and only slightly higher-end one, from Potter Violins. I've now had it for 15 years and it's still in good shape. I haven't played in years so I'm super rusty. I love the cello, its sound, and how it looks, just like I did when I was a kid, but I'm not sure if it still fits me since I'm now a hulking 5'2. If I remember correctly, I think it's a 3/4. It's a replica of Erlangen by Wilhelm Klier.

I have a budget of maybe up to $1,800. My cello was around $3,500. I made two appointments with luthiers near me to discuss a potential trade-in for a 7/8 or 4/4 cello if they fit better. I visited a luthier several months ago to get it appraised and he estimated it for around $1,300, which seemed kind of low to me, and I got the feeling I was being lowballed. I just sat down with my cello and it feels nice and comfortable, but I definitely have to reach a little more to reach the strings than I did when I was younger.

My questions are: Should I trade in for a new cello? How do I avoid being lowballed? And should I go back to Potter Violins to possibly trade in and buy?

Thanks!",Cello,Maybe in the market for a new cello.,,0

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student. If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :)

Note that I will also be happy to continue hosting these meetings on a weekly basis as long as there is interest in them. I will always make a new post each week and add in the zoom details the day of the meeting. Time and day of the week will always be the same though.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where **mistakes are allowed**.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece.
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM BST**. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

My name is Andrew Ascenzo and I’m a cellist from Toronto Canada and I’ve been a member of the community here for a while using my other personal account. I wanted to share a project that I’ve been working on for the last little while. 

When the pandemic was declared in March and all of my performing work was cancelled, I was at a bit of a loss with what to do with my time those first few weeks. I decided to take on a little daily project to keep me occupied and playing until I knew more about what the coming weeks and months would look like, and came up with the idea of a project I called “Self-Isolation Bach.” I would record one movement of the Bach Suites a day and upload a video to Instagram to share with the world. It seemed easy at first but definitely got harder as I approached the 6th Suite!

Over the summer, I began a YouTube project called Pulse with my wife and music therapist SarahRose Black, where we would combine narratives of music and health with live performances and capture these in short video segments. As part of Pulse, we began to create videos reflecting on those early pandemic days when I was working my way through the suites.

Student,1605652761,jw3c20,"Hi! I have played cello for almost 10 years now and I started on a new piece with my teacher called Julie-O by Mark Summer. If you have played this piece before or are working on it right now, I have a few questions. I'm learning on the Carey Chaney arrangement of the piece, so if you learned on the original, there might be a few differences in measure numbers and rhythms than I'm learning.

I have played modern cello pieces before (Robin Hood Changes His Oil by Gideon Freudman is one of my favorites) but I've never played a piece like this one before. I'm not accustomed to some of the strange rhythms and pizzicato methods. I noticed this piece has a lot of strumming and left hand pizz and that is one of the problems I'm struggling with - I've done a bit of strumming before, but not as much as there is in this piece, and left hand pizz is pretty new to me. In particular, measures 39 - 49 are very hard for me to play, and I often get blisters on multiple fingers whenever I try playing it, especially on my right thumb. Any suggestions on how I can get through this section without destroying my fingers?

A specific measure that I am also having trouble with is measure 46 (with the alternating left and right hand pizz). I have practiced this one measure so much for the past couple weeks and yet I still don't seem to be making any progress on it. I can barely play it when I slow it down, and whenever I try to play it faster, it just falls apart. I have tried practicing it slowly and ramping up the tempo when I feel like I've gotten it down at a slower speed, but it doesn't seem to be helping much. I can play through the whole measure 39 - 49 section at tempo (despite the blisters) but this one measure screws me up every time. Am I doing something wrong? Is there another way I can try to learn this one measure?

Finally, I have also been a bit perplexed by the last page. I know its supposed to be similar to the beginning, but it sounds odd whenever I try to play it. My teacher has said that with the last page, you can basically improvise and do your own variation of what's written. I am absolute garbage at improvising with a piece, and I'm kinda stumped on what to do on the last page. I've listened to several recordings and the way the last page is played is always different for different recordings.

Hello!

I have been playing cello for a year now and I have concerns I don’t seem to be able to improve.

- I press my thumb too much against the back of the neck. Even though my fingers are strong, i can’t seem to play if I don’t press my thumb. If I don’t press with my thumb I have the feeling that the cello wiggles around too much and I start making mistakes

- I have a lot of anxiety when I have to learn a new piece with my teacher. If I read a piece alone I take my time figuring it out but the “pressure” of learning a new piece in a new position (and sight reading in this new position) makes me feel super anxious because I feel “dumb” I don’t get it perfectly straight away. We still manage to go through the piece but I have the feeling it would be so much better without this anxiety. Just for the record; my teacher is nice and doesn’t judge/pressure me at all. It’s in my head.

- I am not a very sporty person, but I am young. That said, I am often exhausted after some minutes of practice, like playing the cello is some kind of cardio excercise for me. I am trying to be more “sporty” but I live in a cold country, I cannot jog for health reasons and I barely have space to excercise at home so I am working on that. 

- I travel a lot and it is not always possible to take my acoustic cello - any solution for this?

- Do you think it is too early to start jamming with other beginner musicians? 

What is a good practice routine for a beginners like me? I have heard about the suzuki books but I don’t know much about them, which one should I get first? I can play first position, lower first, extended first, lower second and upper second position.

If you can answer any of these questions thank you very much in advance &lt;3",Cello,Begginer concerns,,0

I've played the cello for some years, but just now started recording it. I bought a Zoom H5 recorder, and recorded some guitar and vocal tracks with it, which turned out to sound quite nice.

But when I tried to mic the cello using the X/Y mic that came with the recorder, I kept getting some high frequency (approx. 5 to 14 kHz) noises that make me cringe every time. At first I thought it might be something with the room I was recording in (it was a really small room full of other stuff) or with the mic itself, but today I tried micking it using also a Shure Beta 58 mic in a bigger room, and got the same noise on the Zoom and Shure mics, no matter how they were positioned.

I recorded a sample on both microphones, here it is [with the Zoom mics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m_avPin2gKgASP58DZ1cd171lHAfY94m/view?usp=sharing) and [with the Shure one](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j-XirMr7IdPIb1zyDsz-wP1KSoY_J9BD/view?usp=sharing). The noise only appears when I start playing on the A string (0:25 onwards). The setup was [as in this picture.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hfLanCG-EbDF0BpG_jiMqjWPmOux0vgK/view?usp=sharing)..

Does anyone knows how to get rid of it, be it on the recording process or on production, without losing much of the instrument's brightness? It is not really audible when hearing it live, and it's kinda driving me crazy.

Thanks in advance!",Cello,High-frequency noise when recording a cello,,0

There where many factors weighing into my decision to get a higher end e-cello rather than an acoustic cello for the same price, one of them being that I live in a block of flats with relatively poor sound insulation. Thus, most days I practice with my ATH-M50x headphones on and I never practice after 10pm. Still, I’m paranoid about whether my neighbors can hear me. For example I can hear my next door neighbor’s three kids screaming very well through the wall. That in itself does not bother me - kids be kids. But I’m worried my practicing could wake up their youngest baby in the evenings (I never practice after 10pm even though I wish I could). 

I measured my cello’s sound levels on open strings (no amp plugged in) giving my bow it all and I can’t go above 70dB whatever I do. Is it actually loud? Is it just about the sound pressure or also about the frequencies?

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student. If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :)

Note that I will also be happy to continue hosting these meetings on a weekly basis as long as there is interest in them. I will always make a new post each week and add in the zoom details the day of the meeting. Time and day of the week will always be the same though.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where **mistakes are allowed**.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece.
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM BST**. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

,1604942000,jr1nol,"hi, so i have a question. i am currently almost 15  yo, and i have been playing on a 3/4 cello for the past 4 years or so. i am short (about 155 cm or so) and tbh i dont know how much taller ill be in general.

my teacher say that there is no need to get a full sized cello for now, and maybe consider buying a 3/4 (my 3/4 is rented). i dont feel any discomfort in terms of size with this cello, so im wondering what do you think.

basically my question is, do you know any people who play on a 3/4 in their adult life? does it limit you as a cellist in any ways? just wondering, cause playing on a 3/4  (or at least a 7/8) might be the case for me cause i also have very small hands.

I've just sort of put up with it for a long time but I feel like I need to get it out of there. The only way to do this is to remove the endpin, therefor the tailpiece, therefor the strings, therefor the bridge...etc.

I've been playing for about a year but never done anything like this.

I played cello in my high school orchestra for four years, then went to college where I’ve majored in a relatively intensive STEM program, so I only played every once in a while. At the time of posting this it’s probably been well over a year since I’ve played at all, but I’ve been thinking of picking it back up casually/as a hobby now that I have fewer classes and labs. However, I’m not sure if since it’s been so long if I should think about investing in a new set of strings/other things — it’s been probably like ~4-5 years since I’ve gotten my acoustic cello (Snow 200 I believe? I would have to double check) and I also have a pretty cheap electric model (probably ~2-3 years old).

I am now thinking I should buy something in between 600 and 1500 euros but I am really unsure. I do not want to spend too much if I don't have to because I am still a student.

Do you know any of these brands? Or can you recommend any others? I have been told that it should be okay to buy them online but I am kind of scared of doing that. There aren't a lot of shops in the area though.

,1604686093,jpa3er,"# Hey everyone,

I’d like to take this opportunity to make a few announcements about several virtual orchestra groups. More cellists are always welcome to participate. Huge apologies for the repost, the old post had to be deleted because it was severely incomplete.

# What are these virtual orchestra groups like?

You can think of these groups as a remote community orchestra. It absolutely does not replace a real orchestral performance, but it certainly can replace sitting alone in our rooms, and we can do it without putting anyone's health at risk. All playing levels are accepted, and these projects and groups cover a wide difficulty range so you can pick and choose as you please. No, this is not a compensated gig. If you are a professional looking for work this is not it; the main demographic consists of amateurs and students. However, if you are bummed about the lack of work right now and want to keep up your chops or give something back to a musical community, you wouldn’t be the only one. All said, it’s a community orchestra.

The key operating principles of virtual orchestras are:

* You record your part in audio (or video) while listening to a click track in your headphones.
* The tracks are collected, edited, and mixed into a full orchestral performance and posted on YouTube (or another similar platform).

# Reddit Symphony Orchestra (r/theredditsymphony)

The RSO has a number of projects open for all musicians. More cellists are especially welcome. RSO runs a wide range of projects spanning a wide range of genres, ensemble groups and difficulty levels, so there should be something for everyone. Submissions are audio only.

[RSO’s youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/RedditSymphonyOrchestra).
Because the RSO has produced a great deal of fruit, here are few examples of projects they have done that have great significance in RSO's history and development. These projects span a wide range of styles and genres:

* [New World Symphony, 4th Movement](https://youtu.be/N0U6Wpc9kws)

* [Gerudo Valley](https://youtu.be/04aFYugYy9Q)

* [Barber: Adagio for Strings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOp-qtiQjKA)
* [Alex Lamotte: Countryside Rigadoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiAHtLLl-k)

All the project information can be found on r/theredditsymphony, and most of the current information is consolidated in a weekly information thread, which is made every Saturday.

 I´m Mattie from Reel Ear. I just wanted to let you know that we just released an amazing Melody Ear Training tool that will help you connect your cello playing directly with the music. You can also use it to improve your rhythm timing, intonation and long tones. Choose the musical variables that you want to work on, hit the play button and the app will give you random melodies based on your choices. Then, you play back what you hear.

We´ll be coming out with an arpeggio ear training app at the end of this month. There is a 15 day free trial. Come and visit us at [reelear.com](https://reelear.com/). We are musicians too and we are here to help you accelerate your music learning journey.",Cello,Ear Training For Cello,,0
,1604370835,jn24ia,"Hi! I'm 20 and would absolutely love to start learning to play the cello. I was wondering if anyone new of online classes I could take. I'm a beginner and would need to learn from the start (I don't even know how to read music). If anyone knows of ressources I'd be super grateful if you could share them with me! 😊

I was also wondering what size cello I needed to get since I'm 5'3! Is there a tool to calculate it? 

Thanks a lot!! 😊",Cello,New here!,,0

Anyone here has tried it?  Did it worked well?

,1604320132,jmmj7y,"Hi all, adult recent learner looking to buy my first cello. Starting to look at shops within a few hours of Boston - any suggestions? I saw a few shops in Providence and heard good things about Paul Perley Cellos in VT. Carriage House/Johnson nearest to Boston seems pretty marked up but a good first stop - thoughts? 

For reference, I’m looking for cellos around $5000, maybe a little more hah. Any tips on old European vs new, etc would be much appreciated! 

Thanks in advance",Cello,Buying in Boston area,,0

,1604178693,jlq8bc,"Hi! Last week i had my first in person lesson in a couple years. Since my last one, I've definitely picked up some bad habits, including not playing toward the bridge. So my teacher told me to spend some time trying to develop my tone down there.

But so far, it sounds kind of terrible. Maybe it's my strings (helicore) or bad rosin (i only have Jade on hand), but it sounds really broken and metallic. 

Will this get better as I practice? Or could it be my instrument and equipment? 

I'm thinking this might get better when I purchase some thicker rosin. If not, what should i keep in mind about my right arm to help my tone near my bridge?",Cello,Playing near the bridge...lol,,0
