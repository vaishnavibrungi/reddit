I like it a lot - better than any of the dozen or more other violins I've tried, but, being an intermediate level instrument, I am worried about some things.  It's not a WOW! sound.  It's a nice sound.  I wonder if it can be made better, to have a little more projection, with a little tweaking.  ""Nice sound"" is pretty good compared to some other violins I've tried, though.  I am also concerned if it has fatal flaws my amateur eye can't detect, or previous repairs I should be concerned about.  I was thinking of taking it to my local luthier (I live in a small town so we really only have one reasonably nearby) to examine, and see what he thinks about it.  Obviously I would pay for his time.  Is this fair game?  Is this something luthiers can do, without taking the instrument apart, since I don't yet own it?  Will they be offended in some way since it's not my instrument, or one they sold me?  Is it worth doing this before I buy, or is it a waste of a luthier's time and my money?  Or since I like it pretty well, and feel like it's ""the one"" for my current needs, should I just buy it and then take it in to see what he can do with it?

I've only been at this for a little over a year so I'm still a complete newbie. I'm having this issue where anything I play on G has a weird raspy sound that accompanies it. It's not the amount of rosin I don't think because I thoroughly clean the strings after every practice and I try to be cognizant of rosining the bow. I've also tried playing on a different violin and I still get this ambient raspy sound with anything I play on that string leading me to think it's my technique. I don't have this issue with the other three strings and I can occasionally get a half decent tone out of them and when I do it's glorious (this is after months of EVERYTHING sounding like I'm bowing with a Brillo pad so it's progress). I've been trying to do a lot of G scales to see if I can figure this out but so far haven't had much success. Is this just another thing that'll eventually click? Or is there a trick to the G string that I may want to try? Thanks in advance.

33,,1623631502,nzah9a,"Hi! So I ended up needing to get a different violin teacher for the upcoming year. I had been with my last one for about 2 years, and the one before that for 2-3 years. I have a new teacher lined up, and the first lesson with them is tomorrow. I got to thinking, I don't really know how to go about finding a good fit for a teacher. The last 2 I had were basically just ones that were available for the time slot I needed. The first one was really great and solidified a lot of good technique early on, so I havnt had many issues since starting my violin journey. They stressed the importance of metronome work and playing well slowly before increasing speed. I was really upset when they were no longer available. The second one seemed a bit scatter brained and I was always having to remind them what we had been working on previously (is this normal?) They were really friendly, although they didn't really offer much feedback aside from saying that my playing sounded very nice. It was rare that they offered much technical feedback i.e. how to practice certain passages, play with a metronome, etc. There were also a lot of times when they would get distracted and go off on tangents about their personal life. We never really had a specific lesson plan or goal outside of getting to the next song in the Suzuki book and picking a random etude to work on. It didn't annoy me enough to switch teachers, but was still annoying none the less... this time around I would really like to find a more goal oriented teacher.

Basically what I'm asking is are there any questions I should be asking my teacher at our initial lesson(s). I'm not really sure how much I should be expecting from them. Like should I expect them to have some sort of lesson plan? Or should it be kind of winging it like my last teacher... Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

Abit about myself:  
Im 30y old and been playing and studying since age 5. It has been a roller coaster of a ride as a violinist.  
I began playing the violin because I got interested from watching tv, the bow stroking a string, and out comes beautiful sound made me interested i think. Not that I knew what i was going into but my parents at that time asked me if I wanted to play the violin . And so I began my journey.  
Got into a school with the help of my parents, we got private lessons and I had a russian teacher for 14 years(up until highschool). In short from here, i have a bachelor, master and master soloist degree in switzerland and have been freelancing and made recordings in projects both chamber music and chamberorchestras around central europe.  


Now, Ive been unmotivated and felt really unhappy to work as a violinist last 4 years and looking for other alternatives.

Do the different materials in bows make a difference in the tone/control? Brazilwood vs carbon fiber vs pernambuco?

51,,1623447748,nxr1iq," I played the violin for a decade in grade school growing up. I was at a pretty good level, in that I was often near concert master or concert master at the district level through middle school. In high school, the competition kind of ramped up, but I was still in the first few chairs usually. Made it to All-State barely. Got private lessons throughout that whole time.

A lot of parents and teachers I feel like overhyped my playing ability though. They thought I was going to be getting scholarships or that I was a prodigy or something, however I knew that I was nowhere near the level required to pursue it as a major in college and make that my career. And really, I didn't want to.

I haven't played the violin for 5 years now, and I'm in another career which I love and is very lucrative.

My issue is lately, I've kind of been thinking - I enjoy listening to classical violin and orchestral music even to this day. But there are a few things holding me back from ever picking up the instrument again.

1. I often times hated sitting in orchestra. Never want to go back to grinding out rehearsals ever again, which was so tedious.
2. I feel as if it's pointless if I'm not playing at a pro-level. The likes of Hahn and Oistrakh will always outclass me and pretty much the entire violin-playing population otherwise. So if a song is to be recorded to be shared and listened to by others, that caliber will be employed. So, then the question that follows is what's the point? If I like the song, why shouldn't I merely listen to them play it? What do I gain out of learning the song myself, since playing for others is pointless since it will never sound anywhere near as good as Hahn or Oistrakh. Just feels like a pointless waste of time to me.  


At least with guitar, there's a lot more improvisation opportunities, so you can actually feel like you're being creative and there's a purpose to it. But with violin, you are simply recreating what was composed. There isn't any actual creativity to it; it's almost entirely technical. And your recreation will always be inferior to Hahn or Oistrakh. So then why bother in the first place? I just don't understand.

To be fair, I feel like this about most hobbies that don't have a creative aspect to them. Like, I'm fine with personal programming, because that feels like it has a point - since no on else will exactly implement the application that I want to. Me not being the best programmer doesn't really take that away.

But with classical violin, you're just recreating, and in that case it feels pointless compared to just listening to Hahn or Oistrakh on YouTube.",violinist,"CMV: There's no point in playing the violin (particularly classical music) if you aren't angling to become a professional performer, especially considering how little scope there is for improvisation."
52,,1623445837,nxqcao,"**TLDR (bolded-but here's the main one): do you feel that violin has trained you to be more dexterous with your non-dominant hand?**

I'm a lefty. I began violin at 3. I have only played with the bow in the right hand and never had a problem with it (that I can remember-I guess I was so young when I started, that if I did have handedness problems, I didn't remember, and by the time I started thinking more, the way I held the violin felt 'natural', and playing opposite would have felt off). I played throughout my childhood seriously, and considered conservatory, but ultimately realized that I wanted to be a doctor, and so I took that path, and violin is now my favorite pastime!

I had never really considered playing the violin 'left handed' until a few days ago when I was talking to a mentor of mine who was telling me about how ambidexterity is important in surgery, and how hard he found it to do simple tasks with his LH when he started practicing. This convo got me thinking more about being a lefty, and in the past few days, I have just started to notice that I do many more tasks with my RH than I would have expected (things like using my phone, picking up cups, brushing hair, knitting ...ext.) And while, for most of these tasks (except knitting-I only knit RH-ed), I do prefer my LH, I do oftentimes use my RH. I get the sense that if there is a spectrum in handedness (like how dominantly someone is L or R handed), I suspect that I fall closer to the middle of that spectrum. I would not call myself ambidextrous bc I write exclusively lefty, and do seem to have some more natural LH-edness. 

I wonder if my study of violin has trained me to be more ambidextrous, and that has developed into my daily life in which I do many tasks with my non-dominant hand. I'm not a great example for this, because I can't compare my dexterity before and after I started violin. But, I am wondering--for those of you who started later in life, **do you feel that violin has trained you to be more dexterous with your non-dominant hand** (regardless of if you are R or L handed)? Or, do you feel that your handedness has been an additional hurdle in learning the violin (as in this redditor's opinion [https://www.reddit.com/r/violinist/comments/g17ium/why\_the\_insistence\_on\_left\_handers\_learning/](https://www.reddit.com/r/violinist/comments/g17ium/why_the_insistence_on_left_handers_learning/) 

Originally, I was skeptical of this redditor's perspective, I guess because I am a LH violinist playing the traditional way, and I haven't had any problems, and it feels natural (probably the years of practice, so I guess the preference for me was able to be overcome). But then I was reading an article, that basically hypothesized that the people who succeed in violin are naturally (from a neurological basis) more ambidextrous (whether R or L handed) , and those with a strong LH preference have a hardest time with learning violin (with maybe strongly RH people also having a hard time, but not quite as much). I thought that was an interesting theory, in that nature vs nurture realm (ambidextrous traits) . I'm a 23f, grew up in the US, so I did not grow up in an area that forced people to change hands, but my understanding that when that is practiced, some students are able to overcome their natural proclivities (idk this is anecdotal from my best friend who grew up in pakistan, and immigrated to the US in elementary school and  was likely a lefty, but was trained to be a righty. She still writes and eats (what was trained to her) with her right hand, but does almost everything else with her left, and thinks that she would write and eat with her left if that wasn't conditioned out of her). But I also know, that historically, some lefties were never really able to develop dominance in their RH enough to write and eat comfortably with it-and maybe some of these people were more on the extreme side of LH-edness, and maybe people who are more profoundly left handed do have more significant challenges with learning violin. **For teachers, I am wondering...Have you ever had students who practiced and were just not able to 'overcome' the challenges associated with their handedness? (Those were committed to their practice habit, but just seemed to not be able to develop their non-dominant hand technique). Do you think that the students that are more ambidextrous students, that especially in their early education are the ones told they are 'natural with the violin'?**  I wonder this because if \~10% of the world is LH-ed, and maybe I hypothesize that \~20% of those LH-ed people are strongly left-handed (have less dexterity in the RH), then that means 2% of the population at large would be strongly left-handed, which is such a small number, that it seems reasonable that these students might just be written off as untalented even if they are trying their hardest? And if I make the same assumptions about the RH population, then the strongly RH people would be 18% of the world population. **I ofc recognize that there are a lot of factors that go into learning the violin, and that handedness is probably not a determining factor of much, but I am just interested in anecdotes about teaching, and if you have noticed or suspected any trends in this area. Also would be interested of any violinists who have thoughts about how they feel handedness or ambidexterity has impacted their playing!**",violinist,Handedness and ambidexterity as a violinist: has the violin caused you to have more dexterity in your non-dominant hand?

56,Soloist,1623431674,nxl3tk,"Hello, I've noticed that this subreddit seems to lack a FAQ for beginners.  Scrolling through the sub I've noticed some common questions and mistakes. As I have some time on my hands, I wanted to make an ""all in one"" if you will.

1. Squeaky Playing, Whistling Sounds  
This is usually caused by 4 things. Not enough/too much rosin, bad bow technique, too much/too little pressure/bad strings.  
\-Not enough/too little rosin and how to tell: If your bow is shedding rosin dust like crazy in front of the bridge area (the wood thing holding all 4 strings up in the middle of the violin), then you'll see a coat of white dust on the violin after only a few minutes. This indicates that there is too much rosin on the bow. The best thing you can do is to just use the rosin up, passing it over a towel is fine too but thats just a waste of rosin.   
If you have too little rosin, your bow hairs will slide around on the strings and cause whistling sounds. When you notice this, pass your bow over your cake of rosin 2-6 times depending on how sticky your rosin is. Generally, the more expensive the rosin, the fewer passes you need.  

2. Bridge Slanted  
How to tell: Look at the bridge from the side of the violin, if the feet are raised on one side more so than the other, then your bridge is slanted (usually to the left). Look at your bridge at an angle perpendicular to it, if it looks slanted to one side, then it probably is. The black part of the violin (fingerboard) should be parallel to the bridge.  
What to do: As a beginner, I don't recommend fixing this issue yourself. You could easily break the feet of the bridge if you don't know exactly what you're doing. Take it to your local violin store and ask for it to be adjusted, this will usually be free of cost.  

3. How Tight To Tension The Bow Hairs.  
There should be a slight curve in the wood, not too dramatic but shouldn't be straight as a ruler either.  

4. How To Tune The Violin  
Don't do this step yourself if you're an absolute beginner, bring it to the shop and they'll teach you how to tune it without breaking your instrument. You can try tuning yourself only after they teach you how to tune.   

5. Sweaty Hands  
Play with a fan on or in a cooler environment. Try to relax more.   

6. Bad Intonation (Wrong Notes)  
Play with a tuner and check or buy stickers for your fretboard (ONLY IF YOU HAVE A CHEAP VIOLIN YOU DON'T MIND PUTTING STICKERS ON, DO NOT DO THIS ON AN EXPENSIVE VIOLIN) [https://www.amazon.com/FineFun-Violin-Finger-Fingerboard-Sticker/dp/B01JJ51CRQ](https://www.amazon.com/FineFun-Violin-Finger-Fingerboard-Sticker/dp/B01JJ51CRQ)  

7. Shifting Between Positions  
Undershifting: Relax your hand more, practice the motion slower.  
Overshifting: Hand too relaxed, practice the motion slower.  

8. What Bow Hold To Use  
Personal preference, the most popular bow holds are the ""Russian Bow Hold"" and ""Franco-Belgian Bow Hold"". Video instructions available on Youtube. Choose the hold most comfortable for you.  

9. Violin Maintenance  
Strings: Buy violin string cleaner off amazon and apply to microfibre cloth, hold cloth between thumb and pointer finger with the solution on the string side. With an up and down motion, wipe the strings clean. There will be squeaking, that is normal. Just don't grip the strings too hard or you'll destroy the bridge.  
Other Parts: Use a microfibre cloth (NOT the same one you used for strings), and just wipe the violin down gently. Do NOT add any liquid or chemical, a simple wipe is more than enough. Remember to wipe the wood under where your bow rests. Get every bit of that white rosin dust off. Clean within 4 hours ish or the rosin will start sticking to the wood.  
Keep violin away from direct sunlight, away from all liquids and chemicals, away from food, heat, extreme cold. (30C+ and 5C or under, temperature changes could crack the violin).  

10. Vibrato  
 Hold your palm out facing the sky, pick a finger (pref ring finger) point the ring finger upwards with the top two finger joints. Without moving any of your fingers move your palm towards you using your wrist, then move it back down to starting position and repeat. It's hard to describe the motion without showing it to you. There is good video instruction on Youtube if you don't have a teacher. (NOTE: Learning vibrato before having good intonation is a bad idea, don't do it)  

11. Bow Arm Technique  
Make sure your bow is parallel to the bridge at all times. Bow should be right in the middle of the finger board and bridge.  
Bow hairs should be flat on the string, there are more advanced techniques where you slant the hairs at an angle but as the name suggests, they are advanced, do not attempt them yet. Your elbow should be the one guiding the bow, not your deltoids. For a clearer explanation on this, watch a bow arm technique video on Youtube, there's only a limited amount of information I can convey through text.  

12. How Long To Practice  
3 Hours a day at most, regular breaks every 30 mins or so. Overworking is not at all beneficial musically and technically unless your name is Paganini or Liszt.  

13. How To Practice  
Personal preference, everyone has their own routine. This is mine if you want a good reference:  
15 Mins Scales, major minor harmonic melodic chromatic double stops, arpeggios, consonant intervals.  
15 Mins of Bach  
1 Hour of the piece I'm currently working on  

14. What pieces do I play?  
Buy any beginners violin book from your music store and work on that. Do not attempt anything clearly out of your skill level, you have a chance of injuring yourself in the process without knowing proper technique.  

15. Musical Practice or Mechanical Practice  
Up to you. Musical practice allows you to play more expressively but you learn technique slower while mechanical practice allows you to learn techniques quicker but sacrificing musicality. (I prefer the former)  

16. What Violin Do I Buy?  
Go to your local violin store (DO NOT ORDER ONLINE, USUALLY BAD IDEA) and ignoring looks, try out violins in your budget. Pick the one whose sound you like the most.  

17. Is This Violin From My Grandmas Basement Authentic?  
If it says Stradivarius inside then its likely a German copy. Same for Guaneri. Otherwise, take it to a good violin luthier and have them appraise it for you, nobody on this sub is likely to know, closer inspection by hand is required for appraisals and such.  

18. Is This Piece Within My Skill Level?  
Try it, if you sound like a chicken being tortured then it is too difficult for you, try something easier.

58,Adult Beginner,1623420898,nxgzes,"Based on my online research, I think I already know the answer to these questions is yes. I wanted to get a second opinion from the wealth of experience on this sub. 

I’ve left my violin in the case for 3 years, almost completely untouched. I stored it in a room with constant temperature and very steady humidity so the instrument seems to be in fine condition as far as I can tell. Pegs are still working well, stays in tune, etc. 


I don’t dislike the way my strings sound, but they must have gone off in that time frame, right? I left them at tension that whole time. Should I replace them now?

Similar question about my bow hair. I’ve never rehaired my bows to begin with, three years on top of that in the case (not under tension of course!) should I get a rehair?

The hair isn’t too tight or loose, but would it simply be worn out from age and previous use?

All the seams look fine, the bridge is straight. The varnish has developed some hairline cracks when viewed from the right angle in the light, but I understand that can be normal. I’m not noticing any issues with the violin, but I probably won’t be going into a shop or having an in person lesson for a while here. If anyone has other suggestions for things to check to make sure it’s in good shape I would welcome the input.

In case you don't know me or my posts: Hi, I'm Shayla,I'm 25yo and started to learn the violin 7,5 months ago. I come from prior woood wind exp, but I haven't had a shimmer of strings. I play scales, etudes and pieces around 1 to 2 hours every day. It's my way of unwinding after a long day at work.

&amp;#x200B;

I found this community and hesistantly started uploading my performances. Over the time, I got a solid of 5 to 10 upvotes and likes per video, mostly from the same people, that I really come to like. My posts were never really that popular, but I enjoyed conversing with those people in the comments.

&amp;#x200B;

So, now to my reason of leaving. Recently I got a stretch piece by my teacher (Bach Solo, Partita E-Major, Minuett 1 and 2, Gigue and Bourree. I know, way out of reach, but so much fun to pay!) after I expressed an interest in learning a simplified version of a Bach piece. My teacher knows that I like learning on pieces better than on etudes, so he prmoised me we can start learning double stops on those 2 minuets. Now, don't get me wrong, I still play etudes and they are fun in their own way, but actual music gives me sth that I just don't get from an etude.

Excited as I was, I posted it here, expecting the same 5 people to comment under it that always do and nothing more. I did NOT expect it to blow up this big. I was really astounded by the amount of negative and downright belittleing comments I got under that post. Will this be slow-going? Yes. Is it still slowgoing, after I nearly had one week on it? Yes. Do I regret playing this piece? No. It's beautiful.

What really put the nail in the coffin for me though is this article and the comments under it:

 [The Difference Between Learning to Play the Violin and Dabbling with Advanced Repertoire (violinist.com)](https://www.violinist.com/blog/laurie/20216/28797/) 

Just to put this here, once and for all: I do not ""dabble"". My teacher has a structure and a reason in his lessons and the way he teaches me. I have a structured practice plan, every time I open my vioolin case. I do NOT just pull it out, open imslp and play whatever. Only because that teaching plan does not fit with your own style of teaching or you learned differently, doesn't make any other teaching methods invalid. I play etudes and scales just like any other violin student as well.

I get it, at the end of the day it's the internet and everyone can have their own opinion on what people publish. I, myself, have no further interest in making myself that vulnerable and open to attacks on my person any longer, so I will unsub from this reddit.

Improving one's skills, on the other hand, seems much harder. I feel improvement is an uphill battle and one really needs to put in a few hours per day in practice over a fairly long period of time for results to show. For most great players, they probably built up their skills as teenagers or in their early 20s by practicing long hours. Has anybody here managed to improve dramatically as an adult, while working a full-time job?  If so, how did you do it?

I recently received an old violin from my grandmother. It was her father's instrument, which he got in about 1906 in upper peninsula Michigan. We know nothing about it, except that story and that the instrument is in *terrible* condition. I brought it to a shop and they said it would take 5-10 thousand to get it back to playing condition, so that is not going to happen.

I spotted a label on the inside of the piece, which reads

The person at the violin shop said that it was probably a fake, but only gave it a cursory glance. Are there any tips for identifying if it is legitimate or not?

They are more fun to play! My teacher pointed out I'm holding my bow without as much thought as when I started (and my fingers hardly hurt anymore!) but I really struggle with bowing straight. I can't see without looking into a mirror but I really want to learn how to ""feel"" where to move it back to when I go crooked. I cannot see this just looking down at the violin and when I'm following along with my song I have a tendency to move the bow crooked and can't seem to get it back in line without looking in a mirror.

74,,1623288352,nwbn9s,"Hi! 

Is it possible (for an advanced player) to transition from a normal note to the harmonic of that note by slowly decreasing finger pressure on the string?  


For example: On the violin, play a G on the D string, then reduce finger pressure to produce the 4th harmonic of the D string, which would sound a D two octaves above, all while playing the same bow-stroke (continuous note).  


It's okay if the transition between the two notes produces some interesting sound, but is this something that can be done?  


I'll attach a screenshot of how I would notate it.

82,Adult Beginner,1623224671,nvq4xt,"Bow hold is a problem I’ve had for what seems like forever. To explain, I have a very comfortable bow hold that looks proper, feels comfortable, is flexible, I can even do Colle to some extent (it’s way closer to the Franco-Belgian hold I think) - so it’s basically what we aim for, right? But that is only true when I’m simply holding the bow, or playing on the lower 3/4’s of the bow. Once I reach the upper quarter my bow hold has to change somehow otherwise I can’t reach the tip with a straight bow.

I’ve tried different ways (when I reached the upper quarter): dislodging my shoulder (obviously a very bad idea, so stopped immediately), putting the weight on my ring finger (kept my bow hold like an FB but obviously I couldn’t give weight to the bow to keep the sound sustained, and my index became oddly curved above the bow), simply not going straight after that point (doesn’t sound very good and from what I’ve read isn’t suggested for beginners that need to learn how a straight bow looks before doing such things), holding the bow a bit higher (I did get a bir higher and it worked a little bit but any higher and I feel like I’m losing the control). These were basically failed attempts. 

One thing that works a bit is pronating my arm more therefore giving the necessary weight, and I can reach a little bit more, though still a few inches left at the tip. The problem with this one is that it puts tension on my forearm and wrist which might be a recipe for injuries. I’m thinking maybe the muscles need to adapt as they never had to do such movements but I’m not sure if this is the way to go. 
The other thing that works a little is really changing my bow hold from what is more an FB to something way closer to Russian at the tip (maybe with differing degrees, so sometimes I went almost full Russian mode, whereas other times I tried to keep in between as much as possible). Basically, the area where my index finger contacts the bow changes and I get more on top of the bow. Now, this is what my teacher suggested, she actually said “Can you not fix it later?”. Yes I can, but it’s really not efficient. It’s not efficient during a slow bow, I can’t imagine how inefficient it would be on fast and long bows. 

This was a long post… But long story short, I want to ask your opinion on this matter. (By the way I don’t think I’m too short, more like average so I don’t think I have short arms, but I don’t know.) How do you guys reach the tip?

89,,1623183103,nvd6eu,"Pictures below...  
This, at least, is the story we were told: in about 1965 my dad, at age 15, was working for a cousin one summer tearing down an old house. It was on Church St. in Tupelo, Mississippi. It was a big old wooden house, probably from the 1890's to 1910's. Inside one of the walls, he found a case with a violin inside. The cousin told him he could keep it (or so he told us), and he kept it in his closet for about 50 years. We started looking at getting some more information on it last year and then my dad passed away in February. A few days ago I did get it back from a local shop with an appraisal on its worth for tax purposes.

We wish we knew more about its history. There is a label inside the violin that reads:  
""RENE BAILLY, 719 Julien Ave. Dubuque, Iowa, Son of Paul Bailly, Paris. Awarded 10 Gold and Silver Medals Paris Exposition.""

How it went from Dubuque to Tupelo, MS, we will probably never know. We don't know the names of the families in that house, or at this point even the address, much less why they put it inside the wall of the house and forgot about it. My dad was a bit of a mess and I've harbored some suspicion about the story, but my mom feels certain the origin he told was true - and they were together since high school. About the label: would the medals have been awarded to the creator (Rene) for his work on other instruments or to a person playing this particular instrument? Was the exposition something that occurred frequently, and when might it have been?

Finally, we have no idea what to do with it. We aren't a musical family, and it looks like it needs some work to get in playable condition (maybe as much as it's total valuation currently). I guess I'd look at having it auctioned off, but getting a stand and keeping it on display in the house has some appeal (though without a bridge and strings it doesn't look as cool).

What would you do with it? Any other thoughts or suggestions on it?

Regardless of where you are, and when you started, you can definitely reach the speed and left hand proficiency of any violinist you see (unless you have some medical issue with your hand). It is only a question of persistence and time.

There are three components in left hand technique: dexterity and ""sense of beat"" of fingers, precision of finger placement on the fingerboard at different positions, and stretch. Fundamentally, those are not that much different from, say, demands on a karate student or a juggler apprentice or a dancer. Enough running, stretches and (mindful) repetitions are bound to bring you were you want to be. Your talents, or in-born coordination and flexibility, would help you move faster. But ultimately, having patience and persistence, you will get there. Maybe only super-flex-stretch-fast pieces like Ernst and some Paganini would be not within the realm of practical reachability for an adult beginner, for example. But this is like a small fraction of a percent of all a violinist could play!

My current teacher charges $75 per hour in the summer while the other teacher (let’s call her teacher 2) charges $40/hr, but my current teacher reduces lessons to $50/hr in the school year. 

My first option is to stick with my current teacher and take biweekly lessons. 

My second option is to study with teacher 2 and take weekly lessons for $40/ hr, but teacher 2 lives around 30-40 minutes away. However she is doing online lessons right now and she is willing to do online lessons even if I move out of state for college in 14 months. 

However, I’ve studied with my current teacher for about 8 months now and she’s helped me tremendously and I can also text her questions about practicing outside of our lesson. Teacher 2 is also very experienced and talented as I’ve heard from friends but the only problem is that I haven’t built as strong of a connection with her right now than as my current teacher and the commute to teacher 2 is around 40 minutes.

I can’t quite decide between these two teachers as they are both excellent teachers and travel time and cost are my two major issues which I’m debating.

I’m very slightly leaning towards teacher 2 since she is less expensive and I can afford weekly lessons, and I will also be able to take online lessons in college when I go there in 16 months.

I'm finding myself in a bit of a hairy situation...

I'm looking to get a carbon fiber violin https://fiddlershop.com/collections/violins/products/mezzo-forte-design-line-violin-with-wood-finish and will also need a new bow.  When looking into carbon fiber bows, I noticed that the hair they come with is from different species of horses.  I was originally contemplating getting a $600 bow https://fiddlershop.com/collections/carbon-fiber-violin-bows/products/fiddlerman-pro-series-violin-bow and saw that Mongolian horsehair was specifically mentioned.  So I did some research and want to know what kind of rabbit (or gopher) hole I have wandered into.

How much of a difference does different breeds of horse hair make?

Do luthiers often carry several types of horse hair or will this be a deal that I should get two bows and ship one at a time off back to the fiddlershop for rehearing?  I'm guessing that I should have it redhaired with the original type that came with the bow.

Or am I just splitting hairs here? (I'm done with the puns, couldn't help it.  Child hood of watching Laurel and Hardy, Abbot and Costello, and Three Stooges instead of learning violin back then).

I'm only playing for a year (in Suzuki book 2 / Essential Elements Vol 2 right now).  My current setup is a starter wooden violin that came with a bow, rosin and case for $250.

133,Amateur,1622785238,nrxofa,"So I recently got a new bridge cut and fit for my violin and some bowing things that were borderline impossible like the Mendelssohn four-string ricochet suddenly became much easier (relatively speaking).  So I've been working a lot on the Mendelssohn ricochet passage and getting it cleaner and more consistent and I've been making slow but steady progress.  So naturally, I got cocky and started looking at the Ricci arrangement of Recuerdos.  I'm pretty baffled.

Can anyone here actually play this competently and consistently?  If so, please post a jam video and answer my questions.  =)

With the Mendelssohn, I've found that some of the left hand chords allow the bow to bounce more than others.  I'm assuming this is because you're stretching the string, which pulls it more taut, which allows more of a bounce.  For instance, when I try to do four-string ricochet with all open strings, it's much, much harder to get it clean with good bounces than with the starting chord of the passage (B,G,B,E from low to high).  Ricochet is also very sensitive to contact point, which is frustrating me further.

I've discovered the same is true for the Recuerdos, but it's even worse.  Getting a smooth cycling single-string ricochet feels much easier for me on the D string than on A.  E is the hardest.  I have to use some right hand index finger pressure to get any real ricochet going on the E string, but then it's hard to get it to cycle repeatedly.

I've looked for youtubes of great players explaining ricochet relevant to Recuerdos.  There are a few like from Kerson Leong and Augustin Hadelich, but they give general tips of modest usefulness and not how to build it up through practice.

I'm definitely willing to sink many hours into this, but I don't even know where to start.  If anyone has learned this bow technique, what did your practice progression look like?  What exercises did you cook up to take you from zero to Recuerdos-hero?

To elaborate… You see, I live in a country that has a different currency than dollars or euros, and my currency has significantly lower value than those currencies. When I look online to see what good violins cost, it’s usually tens of thousands of dollars (which would cost me almost ten times more than that in my currency). For example, for simplicity’s sake, let’s say there is a good violin for 20.000 dollars (I hope that would be considered an actually good/not bad at all type of violin…). If a local violin maker built a violin that would be considered on a similar level, would they give it the same price (20.000 dollars) or would they give a price considering their currency (20.000 whatever currency, or more or less whatever it would be in proportion to the average income). 

Or maybe a simpler way to ask this question would be, if you live in an area that uses a currency other than dollars/euros, are violins sold in their dollars/euros equivalent, or for more or less the same number but in your currency?

174,,1622431335,norx0b,"I started playing violin when I was about 8 years old, got lessons on and off for a few years, then unfortunately quit in middle school because I was embarrassed to be in the orchestra (I know :( ). I played some in high school and then got lessons again in college and really wanted to do something more serious with it, but alas, life got in the way again.

Now in my 30s I overall hadn't played much, I'd go through stints of playing more, but this winter I started playing a lot. At first every few days, then when I decided to do a 100 day project with a variety of creative arts (drawing, writing, violin, etc.) I actually ended up focusing on the violin and playing it most days. I played more Jan-March than I had in years! 

I've played more in the past 5 months than the last 5 years! It'sincredible. I did invest in every other week lessons (found an incredible teacher but he's getting busier now that stuff is opening again). I do recommend lessons to those who can swing it, but of course there is plenty available online now compared to when I was a wee lass. The combination of using online resources and videos, along with this sub, and the lessons, has added up to some awesome progress. I've been working on pieces with shifting into third/fifth/etc. (which I had zero confidence in prior to a few months ago), both parts of the Bach concerto for two violins (I'd only ever played the 2nd), and the unfortunately neglected skill of vibrato due to breaks in instruction. I do intend to post a playing video here soon if I work up the courage (not the Bach haha)!

**Now for my silly good news / bad news:** *The Good -* I've been practicing a lot and to those of you who avoid it (like I did when I was younger in between lessons and/or when I didn't have lessons prompting me to perform a bit), I swear it really does work! I was always trying to coast by on the bit of natural talent I had, but it is soo much about that practice, however you do it. (Fun to see progress in two week chunks looking back at what I learned.)

*The bad news?!* I played enough that my left thumb joints started hurting the other day (a lot more daily practice lately) and I had to take a rest day the next day, and then today my right forearm hurt after playing for a while, and tonight I'm having some elbow pain. So yeah, that's not great, and now I am going to look for more resources on correct posture and such, but if I'm being completely honest part of me is just like wow, nice job playing enough you're getting mildly injured :-P

I'm a composer amd I am doing a set of recordings with a seemingly good violinist and pianist. We're running into a snag with one passage. I turn to you advanced virtuosi for help:

It involves harmonics and long slow high notes.

In this mostly quite playable piece, there are these three measures where I've asked the player to play a long cresc/decresc A5 harmonic then same dynamics for a 5th above that (E6)harmonic,  then same for a long G6 harmonic. He's cracking his tone every time on the G6 harmonic and I'm thinking of giving up on the color (even though it's exactly the kind of ringing-metallic kind of tone needed there) and asking him to play the G6 normally. 

I think he's being heroic saying he's goimg to try hard to do it. But I have come to a point where I just want to find am easy out for the both of us. But with a language barrier I have to deliver my point very succinctly. 

I wonder:
1) is G6 artificial harmonic a terrible ask?
2) is it more easily successful if it's sul A and he does G (a 7th above) and then the fingered harmonic? 
3) is the sans vibrato fundamental note G6 harder to do?

I'm taking bi-weekly classes so that I can balance practice and study, and that works great for me. I have a little bit of prior experience in music and my teacher keeps commenting that I'm progressing very quickly, so I wouldn't say that the extra time between lesson is hindering me.

The only thing is that whenever I have midterms or finals coming up, I start off thinking I'll be able to handle having a lesson also around that time, but then a couple of days before I realize that it's really not ideal (can't practice efficiently when I have to do exam prep and having a lesson close to an test date makes it so I can't really focus on the lesson well either).

Is it okay to keep notifying my teacher a couple days before the lesson that I would like to delay it to the week after or is it rude to my teacher? This really only happens twice per semester, although this summer is split into two mini-semesters, so it could happen four times this summer. 

Maybe I could try to just never schedule a class around midterm / finals period, but then the schedule won't be as regular as straight biweekly lessons. I guess if I wind up delaying the lessons it winds up being the same anyway. 

The result is just a little awkward. For example I would like to delay my next lesson to a week later, but then two weeks after that lands right before the start of my first exam period. I don't know the dates of my exams, so it could be a full week before (which would be fine) or much closer (not okay). So to be safe, I would have to reschedule it to almost a month after next lesson, potentially rescheduling it earlier if I finish early in the exam period, and I'm not sure how that looks to my teacher. It's likely the same thing would happen for my second summer term also.

I don't like weekly lessons because I feel like it's not enough time for me to practice well and I like going into my lessons feeling prepared. I think it makes better use of the lesson time for both my teacher and I. It also helps me feel more motivated because I don't feel forced to practice when I don't want to. Every time I pick up the instrument it brings me joy and not frustration. I want to keep enjoying that kind of freedom and I would never want the ""stress"" of lessons to get in the way of the love I have for music. I dabble in a couple of instruments and I enjoy rotating between them when I have more time between my lessons as well.

Could anyone guide me on the proper ethics of class scheduling? Is it okay to have sometimes biweekly sometimes monthly lessons to avoid rescheduling? When I requested moving from weekly to biweekly lessons my teacher said that she normally didn't support students having biweekly lessons but that she would accept it in my case. I guess I'm just nervous about what she'll think if I end up sometimes scheduling monthly lessons because of exam timing, even if it's what's best for me for all the reasons I stated above. 

Rationally I know that I pay her and so, the weird scheduling probably isn't a big deal, but I still feel like I'm imposing an inconvenience and implying things about my commitment to the instrument (implications which couldn't be more wrong), and that makes me uncomfortable. Should I disregard that and just do what's best for me?

218,,1622150123,nmhu6v,"Hi everyone !

I'm an intermediate player who dropped out years ago due to a combination of feeling too busy at university and a shitty teacher in a city I studied (he for example couldn't be bothered to show up at my exams). I'm actually still extremely busy, but I've been wanting to play again and I finally got to digging out my violin again ! And I was super excited to find this subs that seems well alive :) I love the idea of being able to exchange with other players - although having an audience always stressed me out big time and I absolutely hated it. Who knows, maybe I'll get over that and post some jam videos someday !

I played the violin for a long time, but (sadly) never really took advantage of having nice teachers. I was super casual about it, almost never really practiced (except when I had auditions and exams cause it would stress the hell out of me). I thought of quitting for some years but I'm glad I never did :) Which leads me to the main point of this post : I'm not really sure how to practice efficiently. I mean do I just play and play a piece until I can make it sound nice ? Do you guys have some ""techniques"" to share ? I played long enough to know there's no magic solution haha but I'm pretty sure there's also ways to go about it that are more constructive than others :) I guess the only way I know is dividing the piece into chunks and focus on them one by one.

I was told that a ""self-fitting"" bridge would be a lot more affordable but the guy on the phone told me up-front that he would never recommend a self-fitting for an upper-level instrument. I don't have an upper-level instrument, but how bad would a self-fitting bridge be? I'm a beginner and my violin was only $275 to begin with (although I was told it sounds much better than most student violins). At this point, I don't know how to balance what makes sense financially. I can afford $350 if necessary, but would I even notice the difference? And given the amount of money I'm needing to sink into my beater violin, I also somewhat feel like getting a better violin that came with acceptable bridge would, in essence, be like getting a $350 discount on it.

The last time it was appraised was in 2004, so I know I need to set up another appraisal first. I guess my first question--the cello is often remarked on by luthiers as being very interesting/nice/old, but it is of puzzling provenance and has had a lot of work and repairs done to it. As such, I imagine it would be kind of tricky to appraise? Do people ever ""shop around"" for appraisals? What if I took it elsewhere for appraisal and it was deemed to be worth a different amount?

I don't have homeowners or renters insurance, do any of you have experience with separate instrument insurance? Does anyone have any recommendations of who to get insurance through? I assume that it would be easy enough to put the bows on the same policy?

I also know that it is very dependent on the value of the instrument and the level of insurance, but does anyone have a ballpark or range of how much typical insurance can cost?

232,,1622006547,nl95el,"Hi everyone, I’ll try to make this make sense. I am 15F and I have been taking lessons with my violin teacher 23M for about 5 months now, and i think it’s time to say goodbye. The reason why i want to leave  is because I don’t think he can really help me with what Im doing as well as other teachers could. Here are the reasons why I’m considering leaving, and tell me if I’m being too harsh.

1. He is 23, did not go to college for music, and mostly teaches young beginners. I’m not saying I’m advanced or anything, but I have been working on the Accolay Violin Concerto for quite a long time and it’s still not at how I want it to sound

2. Along with number 1, it’s hard to know what he wants me to do technically. I don’t know if this is harsh, and if it is then i’m sorry, but I think that because he didn’t get enough music education, I don’t think he should be teaching me. He barely demonstrates things to me on his own violin, and when he does, it sounds kind of not good at all

2.  Another reason why I’m considering leaving him is because he does not listen to what I need. In my school orchestra class, we have studio class once every week and we basically get critiqued on our playing. One time, for example, I was told by my fellow classmates and teacher to try different fingerings, which I thought was a good idea. I went back to my private teacher and he literally said “What do orchestra teachers know anyway? You sound fine. Let’s move on!” NO!! I don’t sound fine and I feel like you aren’t listening to me. This has happened multiple times.

Ok that’s it, but the reason i don’t want to leave is because he is a very nice person and we have good conversations and he is generally agreeable (except for what i mentioned in #3)

If i should leave him, how do i do it? I cannot do it in person. One because that’s awkward, and two because we pay for violin lessons monthly, so tell him at next weeks lesson I’ll still have to go for the rest of the month, or lose that money. So i’m doing it over text.

I didn’t read music at the beginning, and knew nothing about this instrument. Had to go around the house saying GDAE...Good Dogs Always Eat. Tried to put the shoulder rest on the wrong end. Opened my case upside down. So tired for my brain to read the notes and hard for my hands to go into those positions.

264,Teacher,1621656149,nia9tj,"I've always been interested in teaching students with special circumstances or accommodations, and just over a month after I've started teaching, I've been sent one!

She's older, I don't remember how old exactly, at least late 50s. And she has arthritis. At my school we meet our students in the parking lot due to covid, so I watched her get out of her car and walk over to me and she was noticeably slow and stiff with her movements. She seems to have hunched posture normally as well,  and straightening up to play and adhering the violin to the shoulder seems to be close to the limit of her movement, but I'm not totally sure, since I'm still getting used to teaching students that have never played before and getting them set up with proper posture.

I have of course been experimenting with her, setup wise, to get a good fit. But I've been having issues. She seems to have short shoulders, and a short but wide neck, which means that with my Kun Solo on the violin in a normal spot, the crook of the shoulder rest is actually out past the end of her shoulder. I've never seen this happen before so I'm not quite sure the route to go moving forward.

Making matters worse, the closest thing we have to a shop nearby is a Music and Arts, which has all of two different kinds of shoulder rests, so I can't think of a way to get her a wide selection to try.

We have considered The Way of The Sponge, but I'm not experienced with using sponges because I was an adult beginner, so I've always used a regular shoulder rest. And my other beginning students seem to still have to use a bit of left hand pressure to hold the instrument with sponges, which I would like to avoid if at all possible, considering she already is going to be much stiffer than normal.

We may have no choice, though, because like I said earlier, a usual shoulder rest actually sits out past the end of her shoulder, so I'm not sure even the more innovative ones like a Performa or a Bon Musica will work...

Hi, I'm trying to play the violin part of Antonin Dvorak - Serenade for strings in E Major (Tempo di valse). And i'm having trouble with the fingerings. Right now i'm going 1 3 4 3 2 | 1 1 1    
And yea, i'm not going to cover more fingerings since that triple 'one' finger is a problem. Which fingering should i use?

274,,1621564105,nhhx8u,"[https://imgur.com/a/N6pBY79](https://imgur.com/a/N6pBY79)

Is my understanding correct that these intervals in the first bar are as follows:

  
1. Minor third (g natural +  b flat)

2. Minor third (g natural +  b flat)

3. Minor third (f natural + a flat)

4. Major third (e flat + g natural)

5. Major third (g natural + b natural)  


If that is correct, and armed with that knowledge, can you share how to understand, finger, and practice thirds both in particular to this section and in general?  


Currently I do the following fingering:  
1. 4th and 2nd finger 

2. 4th and 2nd finger 

3. 3rd and 1st finger 

4. Shift down and use 3rd and 1st finger

5. Shift up and use 4th and 2nd finger (or 4th finger and 3rd finger)  


I also try to do the following:

1. Play the notes individually

2. Play the notes together but slowly

3. Use reference notes with the open strings (e.g. if I want an A flat on the E string, I finger the A natural while tuning it to the open A string, then put my finger behind that A natural to get the A flat)  


My issues:

1. If the above is correct, it's merely out of rote, not because I really understand thirds in the musical and technical sense. I fear that I'm missing out on something.  
2. I have a hard time determining if they are in tune or not (it's not like fifths or octaves where I can audibly the fluttering when I'm out of tune) without doing #3 above

3. If I shift down from Minor third to Major third using the same fingers, I can't reliably shift the fingers independently to their final location (since the distance the first finger moves is different from the distance the other finger moves).  


Is this just a matter of:  
1. Practicing over and over 

2. Breaking down the movements (e.g. shift first to the proper position while maintaining finger distance, then only after shifting one moves the finger/s)

2. Some trick/skill/theory (e.g. aural skills) I have yet to learn

3. Something else?  


Appreciate any help, I tried googling ""violin third intervals"" but I either keep getting results about general music theory, third position, or something too abstract for me.

283,Expert,1621486527,ngr70r,"I am currently working with Baerenreiter on reviewing/proofing/editing their drafts for the upcoming release of Beethoven Opus 132 later this year (keep an eye out for it!). In case people are curious and also want to nerd out, I thought I would share some of the interesting considerations that get discussed sometimes ""behind the scenes."" I hope this encourages and inspires some of you to dig deeply into your own music, too.

First, I should note that I have studied the Henle Urtext version edited by Emil Platen, the Kalmus parts with Joachim's fingerings and bowings, and the holograph manuscript from Beethoven himself (a digital copy of which is [here](https://imslp.simssa.ca/files/imglnks/usimg/8/8c/IMSLP396234-PMLP05046--Mus.ms.autogr._Beethoven,_L._v.,_Mendelssohn-Stiftung_11-_Quartetto_Op.132_03.pdf)).

Focusing on the [famous and absolutely gorgeous third movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8TeeYZVe6Q), a little taste of our conversations include:

* The Italian description in the manuscript and whether it should be included given it looks like it may have been written in a hand other than Beethoven's
* The Italian description and whether it is appropriate to capitalize the ""D"" in Divinita which might be more grammatically correct - but is not faithful to the manuscript (which did not capitalize the D)
* The use of the abbreviation ""tenu."" to be faithful to Beethoven's writing when ""ten."" is used more commonly today
* The absence of sforzandos in the 1st violin part on the third 1/8 note when the Andante returns. Was this Beethoven being forgetful? Was it intentional? If so, why?
* The appropriateness of adding in a piano in measure 47 when one version of the manuscript doesn't include this, but it is a popular performance practice.
* What to do about extraneous accidentals that Beethoven included in his manuscript. Ignore them? Include them? Include them but with editorial notes?
* The appropriateness of converting notes Beethoven wrote oddly in 8va form to their normal state.
* The addition of editorial slurs in measure 138 of the 1st violin part and the judgment call of whether this was simply just forgetfulness on Beethoven's part.
* How to play the second to last measure. Why didn't Beethoven just write it out as half notes like earlier in the Molto adagio - and because he broke out the 1/8ths, should we play them differently as a result? How does it all change given the ambiguity of his slurs?

I have a relatively short neck and I feel like the violin is constantly slipping, never staying upright. This makes shifting (esp. back down the neck) very tense and I am also struggling to develop my vibrato because of this. I often practice in front of a mirror and it has made me fully aware of my posture which can be slouched and crooked, my neck sort of protrudes forward to compensate for the violin slipping which causes me to look slightly downward (this might also be a product of my sheet music not being at eye level because I don’t have a proper music stand at home), and I can REALLY feel the consequence of that neck position because it always aches afterwards.

My school is in California, so I guess everything's pricier out here, but still that is a lot for a college student. But on the other hand, this might be my only chance to study with a teacher at such a high level. 

I was wondering, from your experience, if you found studying with high level teachers like this worth the extra bucks? Do they really help you grow musically? Or would finding a music major at the school who obviously charges less suffice?

Because I practiced so hard this morning, after my 2nd piece (Mozart 3) my left hand started cramping up and I messed up the last line of my 4th piece (Bartok's Romanian Dances), I was out of time with my accompanist for that entire last line as well. 

I kind of pulled things back to a controlled pace in the beginning of my last piece (Partita No.2 Sarabande) but absolutely choked the 2nd page of Gigue due to my hand cramping up against the semiquavers.

In the past couple of years, I've joined a few orchestras (most community orchestras), and every semester, I have to audition for one, which is a youth symphony orchestra (that part is important but I'll get on that later).

As of last year, I've hit so many brick walls and as of late I've been feeling really insignificant as a violinist.  I feel for somebody whose been playing for six years, I don't sound as good as I should.  On top of that, I also look at prodigies and I feel even more like a failure.  There are times when I consider quitting the violin just because if people like them exist, what's the point of me trying to make it?  What's the point of me, some failure of a violinist, even trying?  I feel so hopeless.

I also feel extremely helpless too because my youth symphony orchestra has auditions up and I have to get one sent in before May 23 (these are virtual auditions).  I'm preparing Solo Bach (Gavotte en Rondeau, Partita #3 in E Major) and I feel like that sounds awful.  The final section before the theme comes up again is so difficult and it sounds clumsy whenever I play it.  I'm working hard on polishing it but it never sounds good enough.

361,,1620836543,naspp8,"I used to play Violin back in middleschool and on the very rare (like once every 2 year) occasion. 

I ordered a violin through amazon, they said they lost it in the mail and to just keep it if it comes in. So I thought cool then got a second love of mine (Guitar) where I quit after learning like 3 chords and 2 songs because the F chord (it's named that for a reason BTW).

Well, I've been plucking away at the guitar, and have been trying to fiddle (I bought cheap starter instruments because I didn't know if I'd lose interest right away or not, and they'd be fun).

I think I fell in love with fiddling. I was playing the Violin 1 version of Pirates of the Caribean (My favorite song to play) but thought about fiddling as parts of it require fast playing on the E string.... OH MY GOD I have been practicing ""Devil's Dream"" and I have so much fun and I pick away at the guitar (I am much better at violin having played a few years VS guitar where I make a lot of mistakes)

It just seems you're in another realm when you're fiddling as it requires a lot of concentration

**TLDR: My goal is to be able to play a few songs with the guitar (I'd love to be able to take it camping and do this) but I think it's way cooler to fiddle and would LOVE to expand upon this.

I went from playing for around 25-30 hours a week to maybe 10 at most. A lot of that 10 was made up from practicing, so because I was practicing more, my vibrato was still ok throughout the summer. I never stopped taking lessons but the piece I played over the summer (Bach Partita in E Major Prelude) required very little vibrato, and that combined with the reduce playing time really affected it. When school started and I had less time to practice it got even worse. I started pushing my wrist out instead of keeping it straight and I’ve mostly fixed it on my 2nd and 3rd finger, and my 4th is getting there, but my 1st finger is still very tense.

I've been using my bow for years and years since I was having lessons at school and have never had it rehaired - it hasn't lost much hair but it is a bit grotty so I was considering having it rehaired. However, I'm pretty sure it's [this](https://www.gear4music.com/Woodwind-Brass-Strings/Westbury-Bulletwood-Violin-Bow-4-4-Size/1MB8?origin=product-ads&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw-e2EBhAhEiwAJI5jgwpXxojcGFraYNigjwE2GVGYJ3RETnehPjnW8IPYN7sY2RYUdFyx6BoC7goQAvD_BwE) bow so it would probably be more expensive to rehair than it's worth. Should I just get a new bow? If so, what would I be looking at for a budget of around £100? (I by no means need to use all of that unless I'm getting a lot of value out of it, but I'm not really willing to spend much more - I don't even know how much they cost and google isn't too helpful) How much getting used to will a new bow take?

I've also not replaced the strings in years, mostly because I haven't been playing, but I wasn't in the habit of it anyway - I don't think I've ever replaced the G (in over 10 years!) and to my ear it sounds fine. I have a full set of dominant strings and a nearly-full set of spares that have been sitting in the outside pocket of my violin case for years. The case has gone a bit musty, might the spare strings have gone ""bad"" or will they be okay? Should I change the strings now and get more spares? Should I try a different E string? I've only ever used dominants but it's a very-bright sounding violin (Westbury - alas the budget doesn't cover a new violin but I get away with it) anyway and I've heard the dominant E isn't the best, but I'm not sure if the different sound will throw me off.

Nothing fancy, we move quickly because a lot of it is intuitive to music majors.

My aunt caught wind of this and would like me to give her daughter, my cousin (10) violin lessons. 30-45 minutes once maybe twice a week.

6. $300 antique bow
7. different $300 antique bow
8. $250 antique bow

I'm partial to #4. Of course, it's the most expensive, but in real life the sound difference is truly apparent and immediate. #7 and #8 are tied for somewhat distant second with #7 having a more ""austere"" sound to my ear. Then there's something about #5 that jumps out at me. It seems to ""match"" my violin, although I wonder if it's because it's a cheap bow and I'm used to hearing my violin played with a cheap bow, whereas the $500 bow made my violin sound so different I almost don't know how to compare it.

I still don't get how to play the chords **NOT** rolled(as in grabbing the D A and E strings) for the part I put below.

Whether I go through it gently or with more force, it always sounds like a cat being suffocated and no actual notes come out. My teacher told me to play this part with the part of bow near the frog because the hair is thicker and to apply force at the start of each note to grab the strings, but then quickly loosen up to prevent the crunching sound, but I really don't get this at all. I get what he's saying and sometimes after a bit of practice, I can kinda sorta maybe grab all 3 strings and play the 16th notes.

Right now semi-high me is wondering if this interest will continue after I'm sober. After looking some stuff up like ""why learn to play violin"" and getting hit with some facts like ""it will take years to play well"", ""there's a lot time dedicated to practicing"", ""Violin is one of the harder instruments to learn to play"", and ""anywhere from $200 to $10,000,000 for a good violin"", I wonder if I'll stick with it. I know its a lot of discipline (for any skill including this one) and I don't have a good track record with discipline, but I really do love the sound of violin. It can be passionate, smooth, somber, energetic, happy, angry, or anything in-between. I'm not a fan of classical music, but I love what more modern bands, games, and movie soundtracks have done with violin. Plus covers using violin sound pretty good too. I guess when I imagine myself playing an instrument it's playing one passionately like the violin. I feel like you don't look cool while playing the violin, but if I focus and feel the energy and passion of the music, I'll feel cool. Or like that would be end goals? Like my end goal would be to feel swept away in the music I'm playing and less ""I want to look cool and play for people."" Even like playing in an orchestra and being able to play a small part and contribute to the whole of a great musical piece sounds heavenly. 

Anyway, I want to know about the worst parts of beginning to play the violin. I want videos of beginners chords being played over and over to see if I can stand it (since I'll have to do them.) I want to know about the pain, the frustration, the times you almost gave up or realized this wasn't what you thought it'd be. I want my surface level violin fantasies broken and humbled so that I don't go into it with rose colored glasses. I figure if I know the roughest of it going in, then I can gauge whether or not I really want to stick with it. I have previous experience learning to play the piano growing up. But all the desire to play the piano vanished when I realized that all the songs I was playing were boring. I wasn't having fun. I don't want that to happen here. So I feel like my violin fantasies need to be brought back to earth for a real talk.

Holy mackerel vibrato on violin is waaaaay different than cello. My teacher didn't even understand cuz she's never played cello or bass. On cello I never even had to get special instructions on vibrato. You literally just wobble your finger around, it's completely natural. And then I try doing that with the violin and holy crap I can't even MOVE my finger!!! My hand is glued in place trying to hold up the fingerboard. So I learned from my teacher that a lot of violinists use different vibrato techniques such as arm vibrato and man I have yet to produce a single vibrato on my violin. It's waaaay more difficult.

I’m struggling with staccato.  

I come from a background of playing piano and wind instruments, so in my head staccato is always a bouncing feeling.  On piano, to play staccato I think « up » with my fingers.  So when I see staccatos on violin I have this instinct to lift the bow.  My violin teacher says that in violin you don’t always need to lift the bow to get the staccato effect.  Since I still struggle with reliably getting the next note *after* the staccato when I lift my bow, he says that I shouldn’t lift, but rather just produce the feel of staccato while leaving the bow on the strings.  I’ve been trying to figure this out, but since I’ve only had online lessons (we are still in lockdown where I am), I’m really struggling to figure out what it means to play staccato without lifting the bow.  He’s explained it, and shown me via our video lessons, and I can see it working when he does it - I just can’t figure out how to replicate the lightness of the sound.

422,,1620297677,n64d5s,"Hey. This is kinda embarrassing, but I have slowly been forming bad habits, mainly a sloppy bow hold and messy playing.

Because I am an idiot and a procrastinator, I waited far too long with doing anything against it.

Now, I am forcing myself to excessively practice scales, shift exercises, etudes etc, and trying to get intonation, tone, and posture as close to perfect as I can, or at least to the same level they once were.

It is very draining and monotonous, but I guess that’s the price I have to pay for my sloppiness.

But my question is, is there anything that might help me or even be more effective than my method?

423,,1620296444,n642s0,"Hi r/violinist.

I'm trying to learn Sibelius Violin Concerto in D. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever attempted (The next hardest I managed to learn was Bach's Toccata and Fugue arranged for violin by Stuart Carlson which has a lot of nasty double and triple stops)

I'm running into a problem where I'm looking at the music and seeing all these notes that are high as heck. Ordinarily I've managed to learn how to hit these notes correctly by ear - I know what the note is supposed to sound like so after a couple of goes my fingers learn where they need to be and the score is just there to give me a general sense of things. I know this is probably not a great way of doing things but it's how I get by - I haven't had a violin lesson since high school well over a decade ago and I only play for my own enjoyment.

However with Sibelius I'm really struggling to figure out what it's supposed to sound like because every recording I have of it (i) has a full orchestra backing it, (ii) is wickedly fast. 

Even more irritating when I do try to slow down the recording to 0.25 speed the vibrato get's really distracting and makes it even more difficult to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing.

Does anyone have a recording of someone going through Sibelius slowly - note by note?

This would probably also help me get an idea of how what positions I should be playing in. 

It's really frustrating trying to learn this - it feels like I'm so close but so far.

432,,1620246526,n5pqez,"So, this is sort of an ""odd"" question, but I'm just asking in case there is anyone that has an opinion.

I'm a violinist, I've been playing since childhood, albeit with interruptions and I'm exclusively a hobbyist. Recently, I've been listening to tons of contemporary Western classical music, like La Monte Young, Philip Glass, John Adams etc and I got interested in violins that have more than 4 strings. I think there is a small repertoire for these instruments, but nevertheless looks like it is available. I'm also a hobbyist composer, so I wanted to get my hands dirty with one of these non-standard violins to see if I can have some fun.

What I'm confused about is... There doesn't seem to be a consistent number of strings necessary for these instruments. Like I see compositions for 5 string violins, all the way up to 8 string violins. If I'm not mistaken 6 string seems to be the most frequently used by Western classical music composers and 6+ is used by rock/metal etc artists. But I'm not sure about this.

I'm guessing if I play one of these, my skills won't necessarily transfer to the other immediately, so it seems like I need to decide which one to learn... Especially given these instruments are relatively expensive. So if I buy a 6 string violin and start learning it, I don't want to realize a year later ""shoot there are really interesting pieces for 7 string"".

I get much better perspective and real advice from this forum than pretty much anyone irl. I didn’t respond to everyone, but I took every comment into careful consideration and I appreciate them all.

My jury happened this past Saturday. I did well, very well in fact. I haven't gotten the grade sheet back yet but I am confident it will be pretty good. I feel satisfied with my own performance which is really the most important thing. The buildup to that kind of thing is intense, as anyone who has ever done a high-pressure performance will know, so on top of the degree worries it made for a very stressful week. But it turned out well. 

This morning I had a meeting with my counselor/ department head/ aural skills prof/ whatever you want to call her. Her recommendation was that I do the general B.A. As it turns out, my violin teacher didn't quite know what she was talking about as far as the number of lessons, etc that a B.A. in music entails. It's much less rigorous than a B.M. Performance at many schools, but not mine. Apparently the only difference is that the B.M. Performance has 2 more semesters of chamber music, and 2 more semesters of piano required. There are more electives, and a bit more room for flexibility, even room to go for a second degree if you want, but the rigor is basically the same. You still play in orchestra, and still take lessons all 4 years. If I can win the audition, my counselor says, the B.A. degree is enough to get into pretty much anywhere for Grad school. The question, of course, would be whether I can win a Grad audition. She recommended that I investigate the Ed or Therapy degrees further since both are really good options if I want to be ""guaranteed"" a job (which of course I know it isn't a guarantee anyway). That I will do, and keep an open mind about. But to her, she said, the B.A. looked like a good option for me at this point. 

I’m much calmer now. I have the summer, and even most of the next school year, to consider things now which is good.

One thing I’ve realized- or rather one thing I’ve finally acknowledged, is that music and performance is standing in for a lot of things missing in my life. It’s how I find purpose. That’s why I’m so emotionally connected to it and why I feel a need to have it at the center of my life. I won't go into my situation but suffice it to say I don't feel like I have much of anything or anyone to latch onto, besides my love for music. I know it’s not healthy but I have to acknowledge what I’m dealing with mentally. Enough said about that.

I do think there's for sure a path for me into a music career if I choose to take it. It is probably not what I wanted originally but it would be something. I will need to refine my expectations for myself but it isn't necessary to give up the idea completely.  This is not a decision that's going to be made right away, it will take time. I'm continuing how I am for now, keeping multiple doors open.

I trust my teacher that not approving me for what I wanted was the best thing for me, even if it hurt. I have had a few problems in my dealings with her, simply because she is very, very tough. But honestly that's the best kind of teacher. Having high expectations, and sticking to them, is a good thing.

460,Student,1620027940,n3qlz7,"TLDR: I think I'm playing quite well for my level, musicians agree, most others are underwhelmed.

So I'm an adult beginner who has been playing for about 2.5 years now. Corona has somewhat slowed my progress (as violin lessons via Zoom are just not the same as 1:1 lessons), but I'm quite pleased with my progress so far. I practice around 3-5 hours per week. Yeah, it could be more, but at least that's consistent. My intonation and sound is quite good for 2.5 years (although not perfect by any means, of course), I can play in 1st and 3rd position and switch positions in an ok manner. My teacher says my progress is great. Musician friends say my progress is great. I'm playing Rieding op. 36, Shostakovic's ""Die aufgezogene Puppe"" and the Kindertrio by Klengel at the moment, plus Etudes to work on my technique. I also like working on traditional tunes, although I can't go much faster than 100 bmp yet with those (think ""Drowsy Maggie"", ""Dunmore Lassies"" or ""Devil Among the Tailors""). 

So I know  it is important to play for others to overcome stage fright and to get used to comfortably play with other people present, so I usually jump at every possibility to play when someone says ""and how are you doing with your violin lessons?"" With Corona, these possibilities are scarce enough, and I prefer ""live performances"" to recording myself, as I think my phone camera produces a very scratchy violin sound that is definitily much worse than what I actually play (had friends confirm that, so it's not only in my head :D) So the problem is that 90% of the times I play for non-musicians, even if I liked my performance myself, they're usually like ""yeah well.... you still have a lot to learn."" If I play for musician friends they're usually over the moon ""Wow that is sooo good for 2 years, that's great progress, can't believe you're already playing that!"" Pre-Corona, I even played with some of them in a ""private jam session"" kind of setting once, so I guess it can't be that bad, right? But I can't do this at the moment because they live far away and there are still quite strict lockdown restrictions.

But that look of disappointment really hurts me. Yesterday neighbours came over for a coffee and asked about my progress, I told them how it is and they asked to hear something. Afterwards, one commented in a polite manner, but looked rather underwhelmed. The other said ""yeah I know that it's a lot of work and I'm impressed how consistent and patient you are with practice but it really takes MANY years for a violin to sound enjoyable for others"". Bam, self-confidence crushed again. When I started, I just wanted to have fun playing and learning, I am proud of what I have already achieved, but this is really getting to me and it triggers some really ""traumatic"" memories from the past. I had piano lessons as a kid/teenager for like 10 years and always had the feeling I was getting on people's nerves when I was practicing and I needed to play perfectly at recitals or it just wasn't good enough. Once botched up a recital (just the end-of-school year recital of our music school, which wasn't prestigious AT ALL) and my mom told me she was ashamed to admit I was  her daughter. My dad usually said after a recital he ""earned a drink now after listening to all this"". 20-25 years later, that still haunts me. (No, neither me nor my parents are Asian and my parents didn't really play instruments either.) 

Well I guess I'm just not really sure how to proceed. Just don't play for others unless I know the feedback will be okay and fair? But when will be the point where people might be willing to tolerate or even kinda enjoy my playing? Can any of you relate to this or do I just need to develop a thicker skin? And how do I do that?

473,Amateur,1619947813,n32wiv,"I'm not sure if other people are aware this is even happening, but this is a HUGE pet peeve of mine.  Most people know that a track on a classical music CD is the result of tens of takes and the artistry of an audio engineer stitching the best parts of those takes together.  In no way are CD recordings representative of what a human is capable of doing in one take.  I have come to accept this.

What really pisses me off though are videos of live performances, which imply to the viewer that it's all a single take with very little doctoring done other than maybe editing out coughing or adjusting reverb or balancing or something.  *This is not the case at all.*  Most if not all professionally recorded videos on youtube are doctored in tons of ways.  There are varying degrees of fakery being performed and some of them are extremely shameless.

The biggest trick is to use multiple cameras.  This allows you to cut from camera to camera.  So a performer could record a section on one camera angle, doing tons of takes until they get it perfect.  Then they record with another camera angle on the next section.  In editing, you stitch the two together and most people aren't aware that it isn't a single take because of the cut between the two camera angles.  If you're one of those people who catches inconsistencies in movies because it was filmed out of order, you probably notice these things.  Their head is turned in slightly different ways between cuts or a bead of sweat is present in one shot but not the other.  There are lots of giveaways to this sort of thing, but it's usually subtle.  Overall, this is, in my opinion, the least egregious kind of faking live playing depending on the context.  E.g. Hadelich's at-home videos are recorded like this.

But Geige, you say, you can only do that in certain situations and definitely not in a concerto with a live orchestra or something.  You say that, but you're wrong, sadly.  Now we're getting more egregious, in my opinion.  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UTq1eZrDkI) was what made me ragequit youtube today and write this post.  I was trying to get some inspiration for practicing and ended up just having a very angry practice session (although Bach made me feel quite a bit better).  Starting at 5:42 we get a very, very close shot.  The background is oddly pitch black suddenly... The last frame in this shot at 5:47 has Ray with his head turned over the violin and eyes open looking down the fingerboard.  It cuts back to a farther away shot.  In the first frame of the new shot, the orchestra magically reappears and Ray has his eyes closed with his head facing the audience.  If you know what to look for, these tricks are EVERYWHERE not just in this video, but in pretty much every other professionally recorded video like this.  I assume what they do is just have Ray get back on stage without the orchestra and record the tricky parts until he nails them, then they edit them in?  I don't actually know.  I don't mean to pick on Ray Chen here, this was just most immediate example to me since I had just watched it.  I promise your favourite soloist is doing this kind of thing too because I see it all the time.  There are other issues with this particular video, but I just pointed out that particular shot because it nicely illustrates one faking technique.

And sadly, that isn't even the most shameless kind of fakery.  The worst is when videos have other audio overlaying a video.  But even for very consistent violinists, each take tends to be unique.  If you really carefully watch vibrato and bow changes, you can see when things don't quite match up.  Sometimes things really, really don't match up.  I was watching a violin soloist on Digital Concert Hall a while back.  I had missed the live stream of the concert, so after a couple of weeks, it was finally added to the archive (ever wonder why it takes a while sometimes for videos to be archived?).  I was watching the video and there was a moment where the violinist had a perfectly still left hand, yet you heard a big, juicy soloist vibrato.  I rewound the video to watch the note multiple times because I couldn't believe just how flagrant the error was.  I let my subscription to that service lapse.  I'm hesitant to post any big name examples of this, but usually editors do a pretty good job hiding this sort of thing.  For me, vibrato is always the biggest thing that gives it away.  [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/violinist/comments/mb50y0/it_amazes_me_how_much_can_be_done_on_just_four/) was posted here recently.  I'm not actually convinced that we're hearing *anything* that guy played.  It honestly seems like he's miming all of it because there are so many discrepancies everywhere not just in vibrato but everything.  This faking technique is also surprisingly common even with big names, probably even more often in live orchestra situations.  I'm pretty sure certain shots are used of the performer like say from behind the back or a very wide view of the whole orchestra and then you can't see that the hands don't perfectly match up with the audio.

These are just a few faking techniques.  There are others and probably a bunch that I don't even notice and am not aware of.  When you combine all of these techniques, audio engineers and editors have tremendously many options to make a performer seem like they're actually playing what we're hearing.

I honestly find all of this so frustrating I hardly watch violin youtubes anymore.  At this point, I pretty much just assume everything is heavily edited and I go hunting for discrepancies between the audio and video, which just kills my enjoyment especially when I find them, which is most of the time.  I just put them on as audio because I treat them now the same way I treat audio CDs.  They're idealized versions of the pieces that could never be played so well live, despite the whole charade.

I sympathize with performers nowadays.  People expect recordings-- even live recordings-- to be perfect now.  It's just not a realistic expectation, and I guess performers are just giving people what they want.  I don't know.  I would much rather hear what they actually played, even if it's not perfect.  I'm sure Ray has performed the Saint-Saens I&amp;R tons of times.  Why doesn't he just upload whichever performance he likes the most?  Again, I'm just using Ray as a stand-in for all professional performers who do this sort of thing.

I'm curious if other people have noticed this?  Or perhaps just noticed something was ""off"" in some videos.  I'm also curious if anyone here knows any of the dirty details about these types of things?

I started practicing the violin on January this year. I wanted to record my progress. I bought a Samson Q2U mic after watching many reviews.

A couple of months ago, I decided that I did not want to continue playing my violin anymore. I play with the highest level orchestra at my school, but being in orchestra always increases my anxiety and stresses me out. My class is composed of people who have either been practicing their string instrument since they were small, now almost playing their instrument to perfection, and people who are just naturally gifted with the ability to play music on a string instrument. I do not fit into either of those categories, haha! I began playing in 6th grade, (I am currently finishing 8th grade), just because I thought playing the violin would be cool. I think part of why I was so adamant on quitting this year is because I wish I could play better, but I can’t even though I take playing violin very seriously and practice much. This thought worsened as I was placed in an orchestra with some of the most advanced students. I felt, and still feel, like a joke! I know you guys can’t hear me play, but I hope you understand what I’m saying. 
     Now, here’s why I’m in two minds about this situation. Last year, I became infatuated with theater and acting. Acting became a dream of mine that I am still determined to keep doing. I love everything that revolves around acting and theater. I started acting classes, and was excited to quit orchestra so I could pursue theater at my high school. There are only 3 elective slots at my high school, and two of mine are taken up by required electives. I have already chosen theater, but I can easily change it to Orchestra if I change my mind, that’s what my orchestra teacher told me. Everything was fine, I was going to put down the violin, and begin the journey of theater and acting. Until the guilt hit me. This is where I need help. Though I had said that orchestra stresses me out, I feel like if I kept practicing my violin, it could become something I could master. There’s just something in me that wants to keep playing the violin! I feel like I’m wasting the ability to develop a musical skill. Plus, just being able to say I can play the violin really well would be cool. Unfortunately, I still want to do theater too! I wish I could do both theater and orchestra, and I can, just once I become a sophomore, that’s when the required electives will be gone.     
     I’m having horrible trouble trying to make a decision on whether I should just stop orchestra now, or just do theater in sophomore year once I have extra electives. If I could get some helpful detailed input, that would be very much appreciated!

I try to play as loud as I can, by using my entire bow for even short notes, all right in the middle of the bridge and fingerboard, and sometimes if I don't need to worry about dynamics or anything else I'll even press my bow into the string so that anymore and it would start crunching, and she'll still say to play louder/she can barely hear me/etc. She will even come over and press my bow into the string and tell me to play and it crunches so much the whole way and then will say that's how much I need to press down, although I don't actually do that of course because then I would sound like a dying cat. 

I've asked my private teacher how i should play louder and she just said the main thing I should do is just make sure I am playing in that sweet spot between the bridge and fingerboard, and if I want to play even louder to just use more bow, but I shouldn't be squeezing with my index finger on my bow, and she will also tell me to stop squeezing in with my bow lots of the time playing solo stuff because it gives a scratchy/unclean noise. She has also never commented on me playing to quietly, although I guess she wouldn't really be able to notice as we have been on facetime for the past several months. 

I would be thinking the reason my orchestra conductor can't hear me is because we have 4 cellos who are all pretty loud, although the first violin has no problem playing way above everyone else. Their part part is usually higher, although even when I also share solo parts with them I still can't seem to play above everyone else. We just recorded a concert and I watched the video and I could barely hear myself even when I had a solo, though I could easily make out the cellos and first violin. 

Is there anything I should be doing differently? Or is it possible that my violin just isn't very loud? Although it is a somewhat nice strad copy, and I know strads were made to be played above an entire orchestra. Or could it also be a bow problem? I haven't had my bow rehaired in several years (I know, very bad :( I plan on doing that in the next week if I get time), but I can't imagine that would make me so quiet.

Thank you all for any help/advice, this has just been bothering me a bit. School will be out in a few weeks so for the rest of the year all were doing is working on music for next year, but I hope I can fix the problem before next year starts.",violinist,I'm having problems with playing loud

I used to play violin from 4th grade to 1st year in college. I could hold my own in Uni orchestra and the Jr Phill but I was never fantastic and between never getting virbrato to 'click' and some life issues, I stopped playing. 

Flash forward 10 years I picked it up again and for the first time in my life, I get a private teacher. I can still read and count since I taught music for a few years so tune and pitch have been coming relatively easy. Bow control has been taking a bit more time but I am doing a ton of exercises for that in the first month which really helped. 

Anyways, entering month 2, he FINALLY gave me an actual song to play. Which I have now been on for a month... at like 1 line a week. And like I get it. Fundamentals. But I just feel absolutely BORED to tears. At least give me a *few* songs or exercises. No, just ONE song with ONE single way to play at ONE line at a time. I have been looking at some old study books for exercises about w/e he wants me to study just to give me some darn variety of what to play. And it just seems like any time I mention trying anything else he just gives me some 'yeah yeah eventually you have to build up to it and do this (new one lingle 1/2-1 1/2 line chunk) right first'.

522,,1619650315,n0qzv9,"I'm new to violin. But I have some experience on guitar, and I've been wanting to pick up the instrument for years, so I've decided that I'd like to spend the extra money on an intermediate instrument straight away, instead of taking my chances on a student grade violin that might play poorly and push me away from the art.

My local shop owner seems to be trustworthy as far as I can tell. He comes off as very highly intelligent, and definitely has a passion for the craft. He says he's been making instruments for 40 years, and says he enjoys upgrading mass-manufactured instruments and reselling them at a modest markup in addition to the ""professionals only"" tier of instruments he builds himself.

I listened to him play one of his own instruments, and I can say at least based on my limited knowledge that it sounded incredible to me. The sound was full and rich, as good as any instrument I've heard in studio recordings. He says his instruments sell starting at $10,000, which I'd say is pretty reasonable if it plays as good as it sounds.

He has an Angel Taylor V420 for sale. He says it's a model that he has personally torn down and reworked top to bottom. It's a little glassier sounding than his top end hand crafted specimen, but still sounds pretty good. I play electric guitar, and the fingering feels about as light as my $2,500 solid body electric - which is much lighter than I expected - and doesn't appear to buzz or have any other issues. Honestly it plays as smoothly as I would have ever expected having never played violin before.

He says if he charged the going rate on the labor he put into the modifications he made to it, the labor would be worth about $1,500 alone. He says from a playability perspective, he set it up to play as well as his best hand crafted instruments, and that I'd only ever want to upgrade from this instrument if I went professional and/or wanted into the absolute upper echelons of sound quality.

Everything about this feels right at first blush. The guy seems honest, and his passion seems genuine. He's got multiple instruments in various state of construction in his shop, and he says he's currently training an apprentice luthier in his shop. I can't find a negative review on the guy anywhere on the internet.

But he's charging $1,000 for an instrument that retails between $800 and $1,200 based on the few listings I've found for the model. It just seems too good to be true that he's put $1,500 worth of labor into an instrument, only to sell it for basically the middle of the retail price range.

But I honestly can't tell one way or the other, because the instrument sounds great and plays phenomenally well as far as I can tell. There's one small blemish in the finish at the bottom from where a different chin rest was originally installed by the manufacturer, and I think maybe the manufacturer didn't let the varnish dry completely before attaching the factory chin rest. Otherwise the instrument seems literally flawless to my untrained eye.

530,,1619585403,n077n7,"I've been playing/taking lessons for about 9 months now. My violin was gifted to me by my mom a few years ago, and I know she probably spent a couple hundred on it. I know it's a student violin (cremona SV 130 and the cheapo bow it came with) and I know I'm not gonna be playing on it forever, but right now it still is good for my skill level I think. 

However, I recently changed my strings to the D'Addario helicore medium tension. I think I had preludes both of the other times I changed them, so I thought upgrading would be good and give me a bit of a different sound. So far, I hate them. 

I don't know if it's just me or of it's the strings and how soft they seem, or if it's my bow, or maybe even both. It seems like I have to heavily rosin every time I play and they still have a weird screechy sound that my previous strings didn't have. Or maybe not as much? I don't know. But it's horrific, and frustrating when I'm practicing cuz it sounds so bad. It seems like the only things I'm able to play well are slower songs, or ones that are fairly simple. 

I'm working on suzuki book 2 and I'm on the long ago variation, and it sounds fine when I'm going slower, but as soon as I speed up tempo it starts to get that weird screechy scratchy sound and my bow doesn't want to grip the strings it feels like, even after rosining a bunch. I've had them on for at least 2 weeks, so it's not for lack of new strings. I practice for an hour minimum 3-4 times a week, and then I have hour long lessons once a week.

535,Music Major,1619543086,mzt6i8,"Yeah, this post got really long. It was intended to be a simple question to anyone who's been in this situation, what should I do. But it turned into a rant. 

*TL;DR My prof just told me she's not going to recommend me to go for a BM music performance, and that I'm behind due to only getting really serious in high school. I don't want to give up the plan of going to grad school and going for a music career, but I don't have much of a desire to get a music education or therapy degree. I'm at a low point, questioning if I'm even good enough.* 

So, I'm a music major. I'm not at a conservatory, but the university I go to has a very high-level music program that is almost conservatory-equivalent.

Some of you may remember my post from months ago where I got absolutely ripped apart in my first lesson of the semester. I successfully moved on and turned it into motivation to do better. I have prepared a couple of pieces over the semester and my playing has improved a lot, even my teacher has said so several times. I recently had a very good performance in studio.

That's why I was completely unprepared for what happened in my lesson yesterday. It was the last lesson of the semester, with juries in only a few days. My prof and I were talking about repertoire and goals for next semester. Now, at my school, as at most I'm sure, Freshmen start out taking basic music classes, and then choose the degree (performance, education, therapy, composition, or general B.A.) that they want to go into. They have to be approved by private teachers and other faculty to continue in the program they choose.  I filled out the form and put in the degree I've wanted to work towards from the start, a performance degree. I didn't think it would be a problem. But my prof just told me that she doesn't feel comfortable approving me to move forward in that, and wants me to do education or therapy.

The whole conversation has left me upset and confused. She started out by saying that she didn't want me to leave school with no guaranteed job, even if I wind up going on to grad school for music, which she knows I plan to. Yeah, I get it, music isn't exactly the easiest field to find a job in. I've heard all the statistics, and I'm probably crazy for even trying. But I thought I could go on to do what the grad students I'm in ensemble with are doing, teaching and gigging and playing for small orchestras while they prepare for the big auditions and get their masters degrees. From there, there are many paths one can take. My teacher said that you can't teach unless you have an Ed degree, which I didn't think was true. I mean, she's been teaching students of various ages for years and she doesn't have an Ed degree. Even some fellow undergrads I know have students already. Maybe she just meant you can't teach for a living without an Ed degree? Is that true?

Another thing my prof said is, I think, closer to the real reason she won't approve me. She told me again what she mentioned that first lesson, that I'm ""a little bit behind"" for someone who wants to make a career out of being a musician. I told her about my background, that I've played my whole life but only really got serious about in in high school, and didn't practice as much as I should have in elementary and middle school. I only knew I wanted to be a music major once I hit my Junior year. I was a kid, I had not yet found the passion for music that I have now. She said she understands, but ""that's a bit too late"". I can't do anything about it now, so is the answer just to give up? I suppose I'm simply not good enough in her eyes to even get an undergrad performance degree. But I'm still a Freshman. It's not like I'm going to graduate this year. I have time to keep improving, don't I? 

I just don't understand her reasons for this. According to her I've improved so much, then suddenly I'm so behind I can't even go for my degree? I need to get into a program that will land me a job in the music industry, but it's too late for me to make a career out of music at all? I can go to grad school, but I'm not going to make it after undergrad? I'm so confused. Is everything else she said just meant to sugarcoat the simple fact that she thinks I'll never be good enough? 

I have worked very hard, it's definitely not that I'm lazy. There's always another hour of practice that it feels like could be done, always the guilt when I have a bad day. But I thought I was doing well. I have learned the right amount of practice to be at my most productive and I've hardly slacked off once. I'm doing all my ensemble and solo rep and scales and etudes- everything I should be doing. What else, honestly, \*can\* I do? Am I lying to myself that I'm doing well, or that I'm even any good at all? Am I actually lazy? Am I just bad at this? 

Moving forward, I don't quite know what to do. I need to try and focus on doing well at my jury, whatever happens. I have a meeting set up with one of my aural professors who also acts as a career counselor, someone I would trust with absolutely anything. I'm going to tell her about the situation in full detail and see what she thinks my options are. I will see if it really is impossible for me to do the performance degree.  After that, I suppose I have a tough choice to make. I don't want to do education or therapy. I really don't have an interest in either program. The general B.A. in music does not allow for private lessons all 4 years, which if I want any chance to get into a grad school I have to have. I am once again considering  switching teachers or even schools, but if \*I'm\* the problem what good is that going to do? Besides, I \*was\* feeling good about how this school and prof is working for me. Should I just give up being a music major? I don't know, but the thought of that really hurts.  I still feel like I would never be happy doing anything else. I'm not ready to give it up.",violinist,More private teacher struggles

I'm not interested in the value! I know there are many copies of violins and it probably isn't worth much if it's thrown in the garbage. I think the only answers that would disappoint me is ""It's not old at all."" or ""It can't be fixed, it's best to discard it"".

547,,1619465741,mz5ybr,"I’ve been playing the viola for 7, almost 8 years now and recently I decided to pick up the violin for the heck of it. Here’s my 100% absolutely professional opinion of your instrument.

1. The violin is tiny, but in a good way. I have some shoulder issues stemming from playing an instrument that quite frankly, may be a little bit too big for me. The violin is so small and light that if my shoulder is bothering me, I still have an instrument I can play! The size is super weird but I love it. I was really concerned when I first picked up the violin case and noticed how light it was. Turns out, that’s just how it is.

2. It’s really... screechy but no quite? It has a different tone quality from the viola. I now know why my orchestra director fusses at the violin section when they play an open E string. I probably need to work out how hard to press the bow.

3. You guys have zero excuses to not use your fourth finger. It’s not that big of a stretch. You’ll be fine. Your fingers are closer together and your stings aren’t as thick. Just play using a fourth finger, it sounds better.

4. It’s easier to find music. This is what I’ve been jealous of for a super long time. 

5. All my violist friends are preparing to disown me. 

6. My treble clef has really been improving. I occasionally have to read it for the viola, but I’ve never been very good at it. It’s probably a good thing to be able to read at least one of the common clefs and I don’t think alto clef counts.

7. Some problems are universal. I’m allergic to nickel, the material in the metal part of the chin rest. Exact same problem on the violin as on my viola. My bow still bounces. I still have trouble saving my bow. 

I know that violists and violinists love to hate on each other, but both instruments seem fine. I’ll probably always have a preference for the viola but it’s always good to be able to play multiple instruments.",violinist,Initial thoughts of a Violist picking up the violin for the first time

553,,1619414556,myqd37,"It’s almost a cliche saying that we want to bow with “weight” rather than “pressure”. As someone who has a good amount of experience with bowing, I find this concept is even harder to explain than to actually do it. 

Just for example, I once tried to objectively (in my best effort) observe myself while I was playing a simple melody, I have the following messy findings: 

1. I almost feel no weight at the point of bow change. Even at the frog. Or put in another way, most of the momentum caused by bow change are absorbed by fingers before the bow re-engages the string.  

2. What matters more however is the *timing* you start to engage weight; in my case it is “right after” bow change, or the moment the bow starts to engage the string, after the bow change action “settled”. 

3. The weight engagement across from frog to tip is not only not uniform, but wildly uneven; on down bow it tends to feel the heaviest on 1/3 upper bow, on up bow almost always the tip receives the heaviest push and then dying away to a sliver. This produces the sound I like. At this point I start to remember in my distant past teacher’s advice to apply “even weight”/ “heavier towards to tip” across the full bow length, and I never seem to get the desired results. 

4. A random insight: If we are to apply an even (whatever it is weight or speed) approach to any bowing, it is almost always only going to sound “okay”. To draw a good sound, such parameters tends to be uneven in a certain way across the full bow. Yet this secret sauce has seldom been distilled into rules of thumb in a systematic/ pedagogical way? 

5. Are weight and pressure actually *that* different? With soft fingers, much of the force (wherever it comes from wrist or arm) gets absorbed effectively and would only produce a slightly rough sound at worst ? Is finger flexibility rather the actual key variable here? 


After all, I am aware of the limitations of language, it is a terrible medium to accurately describe actual physiological processes. Therefore when we give advices/ evaluate ourselves, we sometimes also rely on sensuality-based statements (“as if you are resting your arm slightly onto the instrument”). How effective it is to different individuals however, is still questionable. We do feel things differently and therefore interpret that target feel also differently. Therefore, I am in a constant search and thinking on: how do we distill the physiology of bowing better (somewhat better than “more speed/weight” perhaps?) , even though it is actually very complicated?",violinist,What do we actually mean when we talk about “weight” on the bow arm
554,,1619411921,mypp6b,"I've been playing piano for 6 years. Too music theory classes in high school but it was centered around piano. Currently, I am re-learning everything since it has been a while.

My violin teacher said to me that C-major is one of the most important scales to know. He explained it as sort of like a base. I'll be honest, my music theory knowledge was super rusty when he was explaining it to me so I didn't catch a lot of it. I do remember that the more sharps you add, the more flats you add as well (or at least that is what I think is correct).

On the piano, there is a half step on the B and C, and E and F. It's easier to see it. Kind of confusing on the violin as well.

I was scrolling by and saw a post Coldplay was promoting for Viva La Vida and was instantly taken back to when I first began looping. Viva La Vida was my FIRST loop creation in 2009 so it holds a special place in my heart to this day

I then thought about my version and how many people that I may have inspired throughout my career and it hit me. I remember logging on to YouTube to see one of my favorite violinist at the time David Garrett announcing a new creation on a pedal board.

There I was in 2013 watching as you, one of my musical icons, began mimicking me without so much as a credit during the intro (I don’t speak German, please correct me). People in my inner circle were upset and I kept defending you in hopes of a shout-out or credit. No one on the web during that time period had my style of looping or had been captured performing the track live in public as extensively as I.

There are so many accounts from People of Color whose inventions or ideas have been stolen, or work minimized, only to be credited when it’s too late. I give you the opportunity to own up or clarify how you got into the Looping Genre and Who inspired you? 

I knew way back then what you (or your team) had done to my career as yours has bled into mine, I’m just curious if YOU are.

582,,1619254776,mxg5s3,"This post partially inspired by the ‘Evolution of violin’ post.

For years now I always tend to catch when a Classical instrument is in a popular song on the radio, and it makes me think back to when I was learning to play viola decades ago. If my teacher back then had me try to figure out a country version “Pictures of You” by The Cure (heard it at a festival, it was great) instead of Dvorak, I would have been far more interested and practiced more. And now, as an adult that hasn’t played in decades, I can hire a teacher and tell them just that. 

As for choosing an instrument to learn to play now, I mostly want to play with the gathering of friends I have, a few of which are in bands and all that. While we all sit around a fire at a BBQ or on the beach, they all say to pick up the guitar or ukulele, easy to learn, etc. But... They already all play guitar and ukulele, they don’t need a new one In the group.

So I want to be different and my past viola experience now makes me think of picking it up again. But from what I remember, and now have read a tiny bit about, is that a viola on its own really is mainly a harmony/back of the band kind of instrument. Whereas a 5-string violin/viola has a broader range, and I’d be able to play most anything from bluegrass/country to rock and alternative with my friends or alone. And a fretted 5-string might be easier to learn on.

I don’t think I’d take a nice wooden violin out to the beach for a night around a fire, but there are composite and other types of materials. And the electric violins out there would be my next step-up, I’m sure (or can one play an electric without an amp around the fire?). I just want to have fun with my friends and do something a bit different, both of which will motivate me to practice more.

So... with that, I am tall with long arms and wonder if I could manage a 5-string viola. It might make life easier with more space for that 5th string. Any recommendations for sizes, and even where to begin to look to get one? I am in Europe and I know there is a violin shop in town, but maybe I can order something more suitable online To learn on. Do they sell 5-string viola/violin string sets, or is that something I have to piece together?

I guess I should ask those of you who do play 5-string violins about your experience?

583,Adult Beginner,1619249049,mxexuf,"Hi everybody!

After some recent posts concerning baroque bows, baroque music, etc. etc., I was tempted to look a bit more closely into the history of the violin and its evolution. “I know that I know nothing”, as the saying goes, but I don’t particularly feel that ignorance is bliss, so I fired up my computer, opened my browser, wrote “history of the violin” into google and…. was quickly overwhelmed. Too many fancy looking websites, all with an air of validity to them, too many articles that never really addressed what I was looking for, too much of everything. 

So, why not ask here, I said to myself, in the sub of all subs (if you’re thinking that I’m trying to ingratiate myself with you, then I must tell you, you’re most certainly wrong. Never could I ever.)

So, first of all, what do I know? Not much really. I know that if we ignore for a second all its many ancestors, the violin’s history starts around the 16th century. It underwent significant changes (baroque to modern?) in the 18th century. And so did the bow. However, this one seems more complicated. I encountered baroque bows such as the Italian Sonata bows and French bows, transitional bows and, finally, the modern bow. So, you see… it’s not very much. Wikipedia could tell you that (which it did; my google search included the words “violin”, “violin bow” and “Wikipedia”, in case you were wondering). 

So, what exactly am I asking? It seems all very removed from the title of this post. If I wanted a book about the history of the violin, just, you know, ask. But be patient, I’m getting there.

Since my knowledge is basic at best, I must assume that the instrument evolved with the music that was written for it, and then in turn the music evolved with the instrument, given all the new possibilities it presented. If this assumption is faulty, please don’t be afraid to correct me. 

This realization in turn led me to the following question:

What does the future look like for the violin? While technical development has increased exponentially over the last few decades, some argue that human evolution has not, as we are externalizing “our need to adapt”. Rather than having to change ourselves, machines do it for us, and in some cases evolutionary accomplishments, like women with wider hips to maximize the chance of a successful birth, might even revert, thanks to modern achievements like C-sections (meaning, women with narrower hips, who had a higher chance of dying during childbirth along with their babies are now able to pass on their genes). 

So? Will the violin's evolution be externalized as well? Does the future lie in post-production? Or will our current violin eventually become something akin to what baroque violins are today - a fancy and no doubt beautiful relic of the past, but still a relic played only by a relatively small minority. How would its successor look like? And if we somehow manage to hold on to it, coming back to my earlier assumption of how instrument and music are related to each other, what does that mean for future music specifically composed for the violin? Obviously, new techniques have emerged, and people are experimenting a lot with what they’re given (I must admit, I’m not all that familiar with new things written for the violin), but eventually we just might hit a wall here. So, will music stagnate as well? I can’t imagine that.

So… where *are* things going?

**Tl;dr: What’s gonna happen to violin-chan?**

If you have any meaningful literature that might give some insight into the violin – past, present, or future – I would definitely welcome it. Online is fine, but I’m more of a print kind of girl. I just love the smell of books and the sound of rustling paper.

So, now it’s time for me to go to bed, but I’m looking forward to your comments, no matter how crazy, random or out of place they might seem. 

Thanks!",violinist,Evolution – Where Are Things Headed?

585,,1619238645,mxcn5q,"Question about long dormant violin/bow

Hi all! Long story short: I'm a lifelong guitar player who acquired a new (or very lightly used) violin about 15 years ago and basically never used it save for a few very short spurts of activity. I think it's a Lidl 26 series. I just opened it back up after probably 5-8 years and have some questions about what I should do. For background, it's been in its case in my parents' basement (well-insulated, no temp/dryness issues) basically forever. Also, I had no idea how to care for the instrument at those various moments of inspiration, but it always went safely back into its case after use. I did NOT wipe rosin off the bow or strings after those moments either. Anyway, here are my questions:

Strings: I assume getting a fresh set of strings on there is a good idea. Was leaning towards D'Addario Prelude. Good call?

Bow (Glasser): Should I just buy a new one? Is there a go-to affordable but not crappy option? Should I see if I can wipe off the old rosin? 

Body: Anything I should check to make sure it's not in need of any major maintenance? I understand I could bring it to a luthier, but I'm a tinkerer, and this isn't exactly a fancy instrument, so please indulge my impulse to DIY my entire life when possible.

I was wondering if maybe it was because it's a cheap violin. I don't know if it is a cheap one, but my parents don't know about violins so I think it's a possibility. In which case I can't ask them to tell me the price or completely replace it for a new one since it was a gift.

There are so many variables! My teacher recommended Dominant synthetic. I thought that would be simple enough, but looks like there's a lot more to it. For example, [this set](https://www.amazon.com/JSI-Special-Violin-String-Set/dp/B000V6FY8Q/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=dominant&amp;qid=1619149499&amp;s=musical-instruments&amp;sr=1-4):

&gt;Full Set includes   
Pirastro Gold Label Plain Steel Loop-End E,   
Thomastik Dominant Aluminum Wound Perlon Core Ball-End A,   
Thomastik Dominant Aluminum Wound Perlon Core Ball-End D,   
Thomastik Dominant Silver Wound Perlon Core Ball-End G

Why is the E steel when the rest are synthetic? And even a different brand apparently? Why do some have ball ends and some have loop ends? Why are some aluminum and some silver? 

[This description](https://fiddlershop.com/collections/violin-string-sets/products/dominant-violin-set) seems more straightforward:

&gt;Dominant series violin strings are one of the most widely-used synthetic strings. A highly flexible, multi-strand nylon core makes these comparable in sound and feel to natural gut. The E string is aluminum/steel or plain steel, ball or loop end.

But again, why is the E string different? And which one should I get?

I'm also looking at the [Dominant Pro string set](https://fiddlershop.com/collections/violin-string-sets/products/thomastik-dominant-pro-violin-string-set). 

&gt;We're delighted to introduce Thomastik Dominant Pro Violin Strings, a new and improved version of the original classic, designed for the modern professional performer.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Dominant Pro has a familiar tone that players can immediately recognize from the regular Dominant set. However, the Pro version provides greater volume, wider dynamic range, and a finer color pallette to draw from.

The full description is long but it sounds incredible. However I'm not sure if ""pro"" means, like, ""deluxe,"" or if it means ""harder to play well."" Probably both? One thing that's different is it has lower tension. I'm not sure what that entails.

But my biggest question is, how do they get on my violin? Is it difficult to do by yourself if you don't know what you're doing, but you have a good tutorial? If I buy from a music shop, will they string it for me? Can I ask my violin teacher or is that weird?",violinist,Questions about strings: where to buy? synthetic or steel? ball or loop?

604,,1619142720,mwkhof,"I know this sub gets questions like this addressed weekly, but really I don't think ""the elephant in the room"" is ever addressed. Seriously, can we address the elephant in the room?

When people learn how to talk as a kid, it's easy. In fact &gt;93% of the people born learn to talk ""perfectly"". No seriously about [7%](https://www.asha.org/about/press-room/quick-facts/) of Americans have speech impairment (most being minor issues), the rest ""learned to speak"" as a child. just by *existing*. No kid was ever forced to learn to talk and we all do.

On the other hand, if you learn language merely a few years after your infancy... You will permanently have an accent your entire life. It's [practically impossible](https://academic.oup.com/applij/article/41/5/787/5530705) for a second language learner to master a language as well as a native speaker. Yes it can be done, but only the top 1% or so can speak a language such that no native speaker can tell the difference.

I was taught that in a lot of ways other skills are this way too. In fact, this was one the pillars of truth in life.

You cannot be a chess grandmaster if you don't start playing as a chess. This is a fact, I don't think there is even one case of that. In fact, I saw Hikaru Nakamura (one of the best chess players) saying you can't be FM, IM or GM if you start as an adult. Which means, if he's right, practically no human, even smartest ones, who started learning chess as an adult (i.e. &gt;=20s) can be a titled chess player. Let that sink in.

And the same thing applies to music. No one who start as an adult can be a professional musician. Maybe a third violinist in a local orchestra? But it's impossible for them to be a soloist or first violin and be paid.

So, I see this as a fact of life. I love playing chess, but I know that no one will ever pay me play chess. And that's ok. I also know no one will pay me play violin.

But it's a curiosity whether you can an adult starter can still master violin to a respectable level. Like imagine a little kid, say someone who has been playing a few years or so, trying to play Chaconne, or Paganini etc. You'd probably cringe and be like... you're 15 years away from that kiddo. Calm your goddamn tits.

Now, let's be realistic, can you *really* say this to an adult? Like is it even possible for someone to start playing violin in their adults and be able to play Chaconne or Paganini? Maybe a few people did in the entire common practice era?

Like seriously, since 1720 has there been a single person who started learning violin as an adult and *actually* performed Partita no 2 in a way that can be regarded ""passable""? We're talking about 300 years! How many people has there been do you think in the entire 300 years? 0? 1? 2?

I studied linguistics and sometimes teach my native language to foreigners. Some say they want to live in a country whose native language is this. As a teacher, I *always* make sure I set the expectations right. Yes you can learn this language, yes you can communicate with people in this language. But no it's impossible for you to be able to speak in a way a native speaker can't tell apart. You will never be able to write a literature book in this language and it'll be considered good. And of course everyone is ok with that.

But this sort of elephant in the room is never addressed when it comes to music.

I just thought I had to get this out and say.

Before I express my frustration and request advice, here is a brief list of my problems regarding tension.

\- Right shoulder- when practicing string crossings, after a few measures of open strings practice, I start feeling tense in my right arm. My teacher told me it was due to my right shoulder and recommended I constantly compare how the shoulder feels relaxed to my actual playing.

\-Left hand: apparently my left hand feels tense due to my thumb, so my teacher gave me a Schradieck exercise on one string where I focus on keeping my thumb relaxed, at some points playing without it making contact with the neck. Even if I am not playing while holding my hand at the neck, I start getting tense. So I've tried again the ""compare feeling relaxed to feeling tense"" method, to no avail.

\-Shifting. I can't seem to access the upper positions without feeling strain, no matter how I manipulate my elbow or my left thumb.

Since eliminating tension is the main goal of practicing fundamentals, I find myself cutting practicing each exercise early. It feels like an exercise in futility practicing string crossings or shifting if I can't even get rid of the tenseness associated with these things. And to be quite frank, the majority of advice I've found online regarding tension elimination equates to ""it hurts when you do that? Well don't do that!""

I was wondering if somebody can recommend any good etudes for practicing double stops. My teacher wants me to experiment a bit more with tone production, bow pressure and finding “the right spot” where the instrument resonates beneath your fingers (I’m paraphrasing a 30 minutes talk here, sorry if it doesn’t make any sense) and thought that incorporating etudes that experiment with double stops would be a nice thing for me to work one. We had a quick look at Hrimaly and Kayser 20. The first one didn’t really convince me, the second one seemed awfully hard. Now the purpose isn’t really to play them fast or up to tempo, but for now just to find the right pressure to make them sing and not feel crunched (+ intonation, hand frame and all that stuff). She told me that if I could come up with another etude she would consider them as well. It would be nice to play something slightly musical for once...

646,,1618853521,mu5tp1,"I've played the violin for about 7 years. I've been a faithful practice for most of that time, though I'd consider my skill level to be average, if a little below that. As I've been preparing my repertoire for my senior recital (Bruch Violin Concerto, Bach Partita no 3, a few other various pieces), I've come to realize that I have truly begun to resent the instrument. 

For me, violin is a constant cycle of frustration, anxiety, and relief. At this point in time, especially with the pandemic, most of my friends have either quit or put away their instruments. I don't plan on continuing to play after I graduate from high school, though I have committed to myself to last at least until then. I'm never been a spontaneous quitter, and my parents have paid good money for continuous private lessons throughout high school and purchasing a better instrument for me than I probably deserve. 

Looking it back on it all, however, I've found I can never point to a time in my life where I've *enjoyed* playing the instrument. Orchestra with friends in school was fun, and I've certainly felt satisfaction at mastering a difficult technique or passage, but nothing I would define has happiness. I'm plagued with horrible performance anxiety, and these days my practice sessions are either spent in frustration or resigned determination. Practicing is a chore, and nothing more. Once I put my 45-60 minutes a day in, I put the thing away and hope not to see it until tomorrow. 

So why keep playing? For me, there's no ecstasy or bliss at finishing a performance or recital with that last, sweeping note. I would define what I feel afterwards as unhealthy relief. After a performance, I can *feel* the knots in my stomach relaxing and can revel for a few hours in the weight that's been taken off my chest. By far, the trade off is lopsided, cumulatively resulting more negative emotion than positive. 

I think expectation is the reason I've continued as long as I have. My parents, who've invested so much in me, and my violin teacher, who thinks I'm better than I am, always shower me with assurances and confidence in me whenever I hesitantly try to talk about my feelings. Quitting would break their hearts, and seeing that would end up breaking mine as well. So I plan to keep going, always motivated but never invigorated, until I finally leave for college and have an excuse to quietly tuck the violin away without raising too much concern. 

In many ways, I feel trapped. Do I deserve to be angry at being given an opportunity many others would envy? Is it my fault I'm in this situation, for not having the drive to hone my talents and practice until I end up banishing my doubts? It feels like I can only direct my emotions at my violin, which is unproductive and does nothing to improve my mood. 

I'm not looking for sympathy. I'm just curious if anyone else has had similar feelings, and if they were able to make peace with it. Thanks.",violinist,My Buried Resentment for the Violin

I thought this was normal, since that's where the string presses in. And from some older posts here, I see that's common with some other players.

However, I recently bought a new violin, and took it to a luthier to check out, since I bought it online. He found a few problems with it. He said the nut was a little too high, the bridge was a little too high, and the fingerboard was curved down 0.5 mm too far, and all these would ""kill my fingers"" to play because they make the strings farther away from the fingerboard than is usual.

He had me put my finger on the E string to demonstrate a spot he claimed was especially painful, but I couldn't feel anything unusual.

I mentioned to him that I my fingers are pretty callused from practicing every day, and he seemed surprised, saying he plays a lot too but he's never had calluses.

Should I not have calluses? Is it normal for violinists to not have calluses? Are my fingers just callused because I've been playing on poor quality student violins with strings placed way too high away from the fingerboard?

678,Teacher,1618591727,ms7a1s,"I was in high school when I first encountered the little piece of plastic that covers the silver winding of so many student bows. 

A friend of mine was getting ready for a performance, needed some help, and asked me for an impromptu lesson. I didn’t have my violin with me, but the two of us found a quiet place to work through the tricky bits of the piece. 

As she played, I noticed that her right index finger kept slipping. I asked to try her instrument. It took about half a second to notice what was causing the problem. I felt a piece of clear plastic covering the silver winding. 

Ironic since the winding is there to give the finger a point of friction. I took it off the bow and that problem was fixed!

Over the years I have noticed that a startling percentage of beginners have that piece of plastic on their bows. Many teachers don’t notice it because their professional bows never had it, and it's fairly inconspicuous. 

I’ve encountered a small number of people who insist that the plastic should be left there to protect the winding from getting tarnished. To me, this makes no sense for two reasons. 

Firstly, most luthiers will clean tarnished windings for free during a re-hair with a polishing cloth, it takes only a minute to do. Secondly as mentioned above the whole point of the winding is to create a point of friction. Plastic is not conducive to that...  

So please, check your bow tonight. If you purchased a bow that was made in a factory and shipped there is a good chance that if you have not taken it off then it’s still on there.",violinist,PSA - Take the plastic off your bow...

And here I am eight months later with the exact same issue: any time I finger a note the violin sounds nasally or choked. Had a luthier take a look at the instrument at the onset to make sure everything was setup properly.

Open strings are god damn gorgeous.

I’ve ran through everything I can think of. Was I applying pressure with my bow arm (for some reason) when I fingered a note? Nope. Exactly the same stroke was being used. When I was thinking about fingerings was my bow technique getting lax? Unfortunately enough, when I isolated just playing any fingered note the tone tanked compared to the open string. Tried slower bow speed, faster bow speed, and nothing. Tried so many different contact points as well. I’ve even tried changing pressure on the finger board — from barring down (nothing to scary) to delicately so that we avoid those pretty harmonics.

That’s what‘s even crazier! My harmonics sound lovely when I isolate them!

I do have a $300 student instrument, but I know from learning other instruments that blaming the instrument is bad praxis — because chances are it’s the student that’s at fault this early in the game!

The entirety of practicing has been done during lockdown/quarantine, so when I bring this up during my lesson my teacher doesn’t hear anything and thinks I sound fine. Maybe my microphone isn’t picking it up.

Or I am crazy.

696,Teacher,1618451876,mr57q8,"Relatively new teacher here.

I've been having trouble I think with my younger students. I'm a bit removed from what it's like to be a young violinist, because I started at 16, and as a composition major, my focus was always on theory. This makes teaching my adult beginners incredibly easy. They arrive at a problem (for example, not being able to distinguish between high and low 2), I explain to them the fix (knowing when and why we do high or low 2), they go ""Oh that makes sense"" and the problem usually goes away instantly. Obviously, posture, grip, and some technique issues take time and lots of reminders, but I can usually see results instantly.

The opposite is true of my younger students, but in a weird way. They arrive at a mistake (a rhythm error), and I go over the fix (this one is long, this one is short, etc.), I finish explaining it, ask them if they understand, they say they do, so we go to play it and they immediately make the same mistake. Now that's fine by itself, I know that translating what you know into the sound that comes out is hard, so I explain it again and have them run the spot again, and get the same thing.

This cycle repeats for like 5 or 10 minutes until I can sense that the kid is starting to get tired of all the troubleshooting, so we move on, leaving the mistake in place.

Bad habits seem totally invincible, especially ones picked up from a bad source that the kid believes is good. I have one student (about 8 years old I think), and she loves bluegrass fiddle music, so she holds the violin with her wrist supinated, lets the violin drop off her shoulder during easy passages, and constantly taps her foot. I've explained to her many times why these are bad and why we need to stop, but like, one, she's picking all this up from watching bluegrass players, and two, she's 8, she's not old enough to logically comprehend why we need to stop these habits.

Obviously, logic and reason aren't going to get me anywhere, so I need to take a new approach.

I've found some slight success with gameifying things. Kids love video games, and kids love winning, so I can get some impressive results out of my younger students by turning simple things into games (my usual is to see how far they can get through a piece without the problem occurring). 

But obviously I can't do this with everything. I need a way to kind of sell the fix to the kid, convince them of how crucial it is.

729,,1617829829,mmc2hv,"Hi

I want to tell my story with violin, because I feel like soon in might be over.

So I'm playing since 2005, with two years break in meantime. From the very beginning I had teachers that didn't care to teach me well, or they didn't know how to. I was also unlucky in that matter, as they changed almost every year for one or another reason.

Somehow I managed to stick with playing that long, but there were countless moments when I wanted to quit, smash the violin, start doing something else but - it came to the situation that I felt sad about loosing all this years of practice and dedication, so I again tried to continue. 

I moved to Russia, looking for teaching of great teachers that I heard about in Europe. I got into conservatory and I found out that most of technique I learned is wrong and I have to re-learn it. My teacher said that at this point it would actually be easier if I would start from the very beginning now.

At the same time teachers didn't really wanted to practise technique with me (I also had to change teachers here, due to some crazy shit, maybe I could write abot it if anyone would want to).

Now I'm about to graduate bachelor degree and I'm so disappointed. I feel like I learned more from Internet than from my current teacher. Lately she actually told me that she's not able to teach me more about my pieces and I have to deal with them myself till the end of the year.

I'm not sure if I'll graduate with no teaching. I'm very depressed about it, I wish to do music without such big problems.

If you're an advanced player aiming to play La Ronde des Lutins or Erlkonig or something, that counts too.

I'll start with some of my goals. One of them is Sarasate's Malagueña. It's not my favorite of his Spanish Dances—that would probably be the Habanera featured in the Violin Jam—nor is it the most difficult.

Another one of my goals is Paganini Caprice 6. I love how it sounds: it's probably my favorite of the 24. It's a bit out of reach now, but hopefully in a year or two I could learn it seriously and bring to performance standard.

759,,1617617116,mkh6w5,"Hi /r/violinist!

I have come into a big problem.. I've always had somewhat sensitive ears - even with ear plugs on and going to a night club, I would have ear pain afterwords. I just figured my threshhold/sensitivity to noise is different than other people - but can't possibly be too unusual

However when playing the violin, I can't play without earplugs in for more than a few minutes before getting very bad ear pains. It hasn't always been like this - but seems to get gradually worse over time with consistent prolonged practice each day. Obviously to protect my hearing, I started playing with ear plugs. Over time, I found that even that became deafening - with my ears ringing and sounding muted after practice. So I would start adding a soft mute. Then that became the same. I try to practice my bowing technique for half an hour or so without the mutes on, but then switch to a heavy mute to protect my ears, but that became a problem too.

For some reason, even with ear plugs and a heavy mute, the violin would still sound piercingly loud. I started playing with those chunky hearing protection headphones (branded as 38db reduction in sound), with ear plugs in as well (20-25db reduction) AND a heavy rubber mute. And now over time (especially since doing more and more practice - around 4 hours per day average over the last couple of months, in blocks of 2+2 hours) it got to the point where my ears feel intense pain, feel worryingly muted and I think my tinitis is being made worse. So I've had to stop playing.

It's got to the point I'm scared I will have to quit the violin. I did a solo recording for orchestra last week and had to take off my violin mute for getting a good sound, and it felt so painful I would have to stop. It's like I was standing in a 120db hardcore rave for 6 hours, yet it was only a few minutes at a time playing my violin without a mute (with ear plugs and hearing protection headphones).

Does anyone know what this could be??? I have noticed that when I completely lift my jaw from the violin while playing, then it sounds as muted and muffled as you would expect it to with a heavy rubber mute and ear plugs. But when I put my jaw back to the violin, even softly (and with a folded pillow case for comfort) it sounds piercingly loud and I can hear every nuance of the bow and sound as if it has no mute on it and is blasting into my ears when playing. Does this mean that the reason it's so loud is because the sound is conducting through the instrument and through my jaw bones right to my ears, bypassing the hearing protection?? Does anyone know anything about this? It's just sad that it's now causing me pain even with so much hearing protection on.

Does anyone else get ear pain or hearing loss issues even playing with ear plugs?

It's got so bad to the point that my ears are now hyper sensitive to even moderate noises outside of playing the violin - if someone is talking too loud or if the TV is too loud, I now get the same ear pains and sensitivity and that stresses me out. I tried going to an audiologist since I was worried about making myself deaf from this - he said my hearing is perfect; however it could be a hearing disorder called Hyperacrusis (increased hearing sensitivity and pain due to prolonged repeated exposure to high levels of sound) but I need to find a specialist doctor to look into if this could be it. 

It's frustrating since I always wear hearing protection and now if I can't address this then I don't think I can have a career in music :| I already had to skip out on providing another recording to my amateur orchestra this weekend.",violinist,Ear pain even wearing ear plugs?

776,Expert,1617481915,mjgneb,"In my freelancing and violin-teaching social media communities online, I've been seeing a rising sentiment against free and reduced-cost music, because professional musicians right now are in dire financial straits thanks to the pandemic. A professional musical colleague recently confronted me with this question: Is community music and music-for-charity actually *hurting* professional music now? Especially when there are pros or semi-pros involved?

Now, this is an unpleasantly zero-sum question, especially given my relationship with music as a semi-pro. I'm hearing:

(1) Semi-pros and pros with decently-paid day jobs (like music educators) -- those that won't starve without gigs -- shouldn't be gigging right now because there aren't enough gigs to around, so they should be saved for those who depend on those gigs to pay their bills.

(2) Pros should never be playing for less than union wage, or wages for pros will be permanently depressed post-pandemic, especially with Management often taking the opportunity of the pandemic to renegotiate CBAs to the detriment of the musicians.

(3) Pros should not be playing anything for free for fun, if the concert isn't free, because people would otherwise be attending another concert that would benefit pros who are being paid. (And they certainly shouldn't play for ""exposure"", but that's always been the common wisdom.)

(4) Our local AFM, which normally turns a blind eye to AFM pros volunteering for fun or who are playing in freeway philharmonics that don't have a union CBA and wage, should start being more aggressive about enforcement. Even though this would likely kill numerous freeway philharmonics and some semi-pro orchestras, theoretically the money would then flow to bigger, healthier organizations.

(5) Pros shouldn't be giving lessons for free or reduced rates for charity, because some of those families might scrape up money for lessons if they were forced to (or someone else would sponsor them and pay the pros fully); therefore such lessons take bread out of the mouths of working musicians.

(6) Community orchestras shouldn't sell tickets, apply for grants, or take donations from non-members, because they are taking away from these things going to professional orchestras. (If members want to donate to keep the group afloat, that's just paying for their hobby and OK.)

For instance, I teach in a music program that provides free instruction to children living below the poverty line. Most of my fellow instructors are public-school music educators, and everyone else has some professional pedagogy training (like Suzuki or Kodaly or whatever). We're paid minimum wage for our time. This is different than a poverty-targeted program across town, which uses truly amateur volunteers (no professional music training beyond having received private lessons as children) and pays them nothing -- and is now killing that approach and replacing it with fully-paid (normal-lesson-fee, sponsored by donations) pro instructors for the reasons cited above.

And personally, as an AFM member, I still play in a community orchestra,  play in a semi-pro orchestra that doesn't pay its members, volunteer for charity gigs, and occasionally gig with freeway philharmonics that don't pay a union wage -- even though strictly speaking none of these things are allowed. I can afford to do it because I have a well-paid ""day job"".

801,Student,1617299055,mi0pqe,"Hi everybody!

I've been playing the violin for two years but sadly, due to the ongoing pandemi,c I haven't had any lesson since August and I can't ask my teacher about this.

I have an extremely unnerving issue with my bow: it's shaky. Now I remember when I began my bow was shaky because my hand was stiff and not relaxed, or because I was gripping the bow too hard, but I got better with time and I try to relax my hand as much as possible, so I'm not sure if this is the sole explanation. It's shaky only on downbows, from slightly before the middle to the tip. I'm not sure if shaky is the right word, I can see the wood woobling a lot, and the sound is not continuous, like it gets interrupted a few times per seconds. But I don't see the hair leaving the string. It's incredibly annoying, and nothing I have tried improved the issue.

Could it be an issue with the bow itself? (I usually wouldn't blame the instrument because I know how bad I am, but...) I noticed today it is slightly warped, with the tip going slightly to the right, seen from above.

I've tried various hair tensions, bow tilt, and using more/less rosin.

I have another issue: I press the fingerboard way too much with my left hand, and I'm not sure how to improve that. When I try to lighten my fingers, I get a weird sound, a bit like if the string was vibrating somewhere between two modes. Pressing more ""breaks"" the sound, making it nice and clean, and then I can release the pressure and sustain the note. But the first action needs to be very strong, almost painful. 

Any idea what could be wrong? I guess I must be stopping the string incorrectl. I try to drop my fingers on the string from the base joint, but I must be missing something. 

I realize those issues are common and hard to assess without seeing me playing, but maybe one of you could recommend an exercice or something to improve those points?

Thank you so much :)",violinist,Pressing hard on the fingerboard and shaky bow

Anyway, I was curious about playing in a ensemble in the future, but I know (no need to tell me, guys) my level of playing isn't good enough to be playing in one of those professional orchestras that go around the world and play in concert halls, so I decided to look on the internet and check if there were any orchestras for beginner musicians just trying to have fun. Turns out there are! A lot, actually. Problem is... when they say late learns, they really mean it. Most of the beginner orchestras I have seen, are for people around 50y+. I am 18. I don't think I'd fit in those orchestras and the adults there will probably see me as a child, which happens to be the same problem I'd have encountered in a youth orchestra, apparently I'm not considered youth anymore.
 Anyway, my question is whether any of you guys know if there's any beginner orchestras (Offbeat, ELLSO, Nelson Centre of Musical Arts in their Adult Beginner Orchestra) but who could take people around my age (18-30)

Even I notice this after I take a recording of myself playing: The playing sounds VERY bland. My teacher describes it as just gliding the bow on the strings and not really digging down into the strings when playing. In legato sections, I would apply pressure by essentially ""twisting"" or pushing down on the bow with my index finger when I am at the tip. That part is fine and I was given exercises for this too.

When it comes to short and frequent stops, my teacher says that I should apply curves to my bow rather than a straight up and down motion to really be able to express the dynamics. Sort of like a U shape. The problem is that I cannot do it; I hit other strings and it is very difficult for me.

I don't have that energy anymore. Now that I'm somewhat more aware of my deficiencies in playing, I'm trying my best to fix them, but to no avail. Every time I listen to myself play, I cringe hard.

Ive been noticing, and my teacher too, that when i play my left hand gets really tense and i cant make it not be tense. I just played the wienawski violin concerto 2 and the bach e major partita (the whole thing) and thats around the point when i noticed it getting really tense. She told me to just relax my hand and pay a lot of attention to it. I think it was because i started to speed it up when i wasnt that confident in my sound and ability to play it? But now its gotten a lot worse, i thought it was tendonitis because ive gotten it twice before, but its not like that feeling. Im playing the Bruch g minor concerto and the bach g minor sonata, and ive been playing both VERY under tempo so that when i increase the tempo it wont be as tense, but i still notice it :(.

849,,1616977765,mfds7y,"I wish we could put multiple flairs on a post. I'd add setup to this one.

I have three violins. One is a Scherl &amp; Roth Karl Herrmann, vintage about 1956. This was bought for me in grade school by my parents, and came with a Scherl &amp; Roth case and an octagonal bow that I really like. (30-some-odd years ago.) Another is a suspected Jackson Guldan, no labels, and I bought it for about $100, including a round Glasser bow and a chipboard case some 20-odd years ago, because I wanted a ""beater"" violin, and I liked the sound of this one.

These are both full-size. I have [small hands and short arms](https://www.reddit.com/r/violinist/comments/mdswpo/comment/gsctjz0) and it has been suggested to me that I look for a 3/4 size violin.

I was gifted one a couple of weeks ago. It's a Stravari Gotthardt VSF, vintage circa 2016-ish. It, too, came with a round bow.

I was practicing today with the 3/4, finishing with the 3 mjnuets from Suzuki 1. Afterward, I played Minuet 3 with both the other violins and the Glasser bow, because I couldn't be bothered to take the octagonal bow out of the case.

It seemed much easier to put dynamics into my playing with both of the full-size violins.

Very frustrated player here. I’m 21 years old, been playing for slightly over 4.5 years, not very consistently because of school and university. I haven’t taken lessons in about a year and a half, so I’ve been working on my own. My intonation used to be terrible and over the past 8 months or so I’ve really improved it by playing with a tuner, but I still struggle terribly with handling more than one of speed, intonation and correct rhythm at the same time. 

I’m working on Vivaldi’s concerto in G minor from suzuki 5, and since my intonation is better and my speed is better, I wanted to try to play with the accompaniment. I’ve been using different youtube videos with the piano, but I just can’t get it right. It’s taken me months to be able to follow through with the rhythm/timing from the accompaniment (not sure how to say this, english is not my first language), and I can only follow through about half of the first movement before I completely miss the piano with my playing. In addition, the second I have to listen to the piano as well as the violin, my intonation dies and I sound absolutely terrible. 

I’m incredibly frustrated that months of working on my intonation go out through the window the second I try to play with the piano because I just can’t handle everything at once. I still catch my posture going bad if I’m too focused on the intonation, or my intonation going bad if I’m too focused on the timing, even without the accompaniment. It doesn’t help that with two degrees and two part time jobs, I barely have time to practice.

I am very conscious of my neighbors and try not to play more than 30 or 40 minutes out loud in the middle of the day.  The rest of my time is with a heavy practice mute.  I hate it, buzzing on the G string sometimes to the point of popping off, all the notes sounding weird.  And its always a surprise how loud I am when i take the mute off, i feel like it makes me more shy to play.

I have considered a silent practice violin and read all the advice against it.  That it will delay progress.  That it doesnt sound much different than a muted violin. Plus its a LOT of money.  

Well, i finally found a music shop with one in stock and went to try it.. and fell in love. Now i had it home for some days and it has CHANGED MY LIFE!!!!   i love it soooo much.  I cant put it down, i am practicing 2-3 hours a day now, and picking it up for a quick tune whenever i pass it.

First, it feels EXACTLY like my other violin.  It doesnt make my bowing sound different or better. I expected it to hide my mistakes.  Perhaps for projection, sure.  Ill make sure to continue playing the acoustic at least 20 mins a day.  Also still using the same bow and shoulder rest 

Second, with headphones i can crank it up.. and my brain feels like i am playing loud!  I dont feel that shyness developing like when i use a mute.

Third, it is SOOOO much nicer than the muted strings to play, just like my regular violin.  Not the extra flat and buzzing sounds i was growing to hate.   Yes it does have that similar muted sound with headphones off.. and it is even quieter than the mute.  I can play a tune at midnight when i wake to get a drink. Its like a tv on low.

Fourth, i can plug my phone in and 1. Play along with spotify or 2. Start my metronome app, and hear the ticking perfectly in the headphones.

Just want to say, it felt rediculous to spend $999 on a practice tool but this is seriously a life changer for me personally and i know i am going to progress so much faster just based on the hours i can play now.",violinist,Finally bought a Silent Violin for practice.. it has changed my life!!

879,Teacher,1615906292,m6asw3,"Here is my confession, I like contemporary music. Not everyone can say the same I know. My first performance of a 21st-century piece caused one member of the audience to gasp at the abrupt downward glissando in the opening statement. 

I listened to the echoing sound of my major 3rd glissando, combined with the panic of a woman who thought I had just lost my mind resonate through the church...glorious.    

Now let me be perfectly clear, not all contemporary music is good, I would even go so far as to say that most of it is very bad and will be lost to the passage of time. But isn’t that true of every time period?

Surely there were bad composers in the time of Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms that are now forgotten!

I would never insist that you have to like all contemporary music, that would be ridiculous. However, I find distaste in the notion that is so often presented that “all New Music is bad”. 

To those who claim to hate new music, my first question is always “well which pieces/composers have you listened to?” Most often that list is very limited or only has student composers on it. (and no, Schoenberg doesn’t count as new music...he’s been dead for 70 years)

There is a notion that ""people don’t like new music"" and so many of us are happy to jump on the bandwagon. Ironically this same notion draws many of the general public away from the classics that we love.  

How many of you have had a conversation with a non-musician, who insisted that they don’t like classical music because it’s boring. Meanwhile, the performance they had ever heard was from their 8-year-old nephew's recorder class. 

I imagine you wanted to wring their neck and tell them that classical music is more than just something to help you doze off. I wonder what these people would think of, the Berlin Philharmonic performing Shostakovich 5 or Beethoven 7 or many of the works you surely hold dear.

That frustrated me immensely, because I have a hard time enjoying myself if I'm not playing in tune, even if the overall sound is good, and it just bred a cycle of frustration at lack of intonation =&gt; more stress =&gt; more tension =&gt; worse playing =&gt; more frustration. 

It's as if my brain was cognizant enough to recognize and be annoyed at my intonation issues, yet couldn't focus enough to muster the right pitches and hear that special brilliance notes seem to have when they're in tune.

After 20 yrs of electric guitar, I decided that I want to learn a classical instrument. I decided to go with violin, because skillfully played, It´s probably the most beautiful sounding instrument. 

Do you guys happen to know any good apps or online courses  that I could use in the learning process?  Maybe something that would guide me all the way through the whole ""beginner period""... Assuming that I would ever get past the beginner period, haha :D 

It doesn´t matter if the app/course isn´t free. I\`m fine in paying a fixed or monthly fee.

Bridge wasn't on already so i mounted it, really carefully, from the first day i had the violin in my hands.

I've been practicing for a while, but the violin kept sounding a lil off for a while, so i was kinda worried about the bridge.

After a month and a half, the violin stopped going out of tune, the tune was perfectly fixed everyday for two weeks straight.

And that made me worry even more, cause as everybody knows, stringed instruments usually go out of tune fast, maybe one or two days.

In addition to that, the E string in the first days was moving way too much on the bridge.

So, what i did was loosen the strings enough to allow me to remove the bridge, aaand...

Well, either my bridge is backwards, or i have no idea, cause now the E string doesn't really move inside its groove, but it's in the higher end of the bridge, which should belong to the G string.

902,Student,1615741089,m4yww0,"Hi! I'm a current high school senior and I'm looking into what college will entail in terms of violin playing. I know I will not pursue a degree in performance (my intended major is chemistry), but I do want to join an orchestra or chamber ensemble and I have looked a bit into music programs for non-majors at the schools I've applied to. I enjoy the instrument and I know I still have much to learn.

I have a couple worries, mostly relating to time for practicing and for balancing music with studies. I would say I am currently a late-intermediate player: I can play most of the solo Bach movements but am rather far from the fugues and the Chaconne. I haven't done many showpieces or any non-Baroque concertos, so a lot of my long-term goals are related to expanding my non-Baroque repertoire and to develop Romantic-era technique.

Based on my level, how feasible do you think it would be for me to continue learning violin on my own in college and beyond? Obviously it's always better to have a teacher, but I'm worried I won't have time or money for lessons in college. I'm not really looking to perform solos or anything; I just want to expand my repertoire and technique. I haven't been exposed much to left-hand pizzicato, artificial harmonics, or staccato, so I would like to improve those at some point, and I would like to learn the great Romantic concertos (i.e. Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, and Brahms).

906,Teacher,1615661812,m4cpsq,"I want to start by saying that I understand that for people who live in apartments, townhouses, etc. the practice mute is a necessity. If that describes your situation then you may disregard the rest of this.

If, however, you can practice without one and you choose to do so then you are my target audience! 

“But why?” you ask, could such a small, innocuous piece of rubber be causing this violin teacher such frustration and grief? Let me explain dear Reddit reader.

Over the years I have encountered many students with what I would call an “unhealthy reliance” on their mute. This spans all age groups and levels from the very beginner to university level violinists who will refuse to perform, rehearse, or even practice without a mute on.

The reason mutes are so appealing is because they hide problems in our playing, but overuse of a mute can hinder tone and intonation. 

The mute dampens the resonance of the instrument, because of this, weight and sounding point become more forgiving. You can dig into the string and it will not sound as offensive as it normally would. Prolonged practice this way will build bad habits and the longer one practices with a mute the worse it will sound once you take it off. 

The intonation problem is more subtle but equally important. Intervals that are played in-tune will resonate or “ring”. With a mute, this phenomenon is also dampened making it harder to differentiate between in-tune and out-of-tune notes.   

In my personal practice, I rarely use a mute. Even in pieces where a mute is indicated I will first practice it without one to make sure I am getting the tone and pitch right. 

There is another element that is more phycological but is worth mentioning. Students that refuse to take the mute off often have a fear of people (sometimes even themselves) hearing them make a mistake. 

I empathize with these students’ fears, but to quote Mimi Zweig “mistakes are neither good nor bad, they’re simply information”. It is what you do with that information that is good or bad and practicing with a mute is hiding from the problems in your playing not confronting them head-on.

So please take the mute off and lock it away. I promise that you will not regret it.",violinist,PSA – Please Stop Practising with a Mute!

Right hand: Thumb to the middle of the leather pad ( I used to be between the pad and the frog ) and perpendicular ( in cross ) with the bow hair. It seems to allow more finger flexibility, but also makes the bow feel a bit more unstable.

I recently had my first lesson in around a year with a new teacher (my old one moved away and the gap was because of covid). I’m 16 and about to begin preparation for ABRSM grade 8. We started on the Bach concerto in A minor and I’ve had the lesson and then 2 days of practice since, but I already feel like I’m playing it at the standard it would usually take me 2-3 weeks to achieve. As in, already beginning to focus more on phrasing and only a couple of bars where I still need to slow it down and work on intonation. It’s nowhere near performance standard obviously, but I’ve grasped the notes much faster than usual. How long would you say it normally takes to bring a piece up to a passable standard? Clearly it’s different for everyone, but is there a usual window that shows the piece is at the right level for you? Thanks",violinist,How long should it take to learn a piece?

953,,1615344423,m1ng36,"When it comes to violin, I really don't know how to practice.   

Let me explain. Some teachers in the past tell me, ""Oh, you know how to practice!"" And to that, I would say, ""Yes, I do know to practice, if by practice you mean how the average violinist practices."" And what occurs in ""average practice"" are mistakes that keep coming back without being ironed out completely, which translates to embarrassing flubs in performance.   

While on that vein, I watched a video that said, ""Your performance of a piece is the average of the last one hundred times you've played it."" What I gather from this statement is that if I make mistakes while practicing (which is supposedly encouraged in many disciplines so we can learn from them,) I am harming my ""average,"" so to speak.  

And this is what scares me. If I put in an hour of practice, trying to iron out a mistake while having a considerable amount of mistakes made, I have basically contributed towards a lower average of accuracy. It has pervaded my thought processes so much that I sometimes abruptly give up playing for the day because I am so scared that I will harm my playing by having more attempts in a passage.

I've recently been practicing less (lot less time!) and probably am not going to improve much more, and I realized that while I'm mostly pretty happy with where I'm at with my baroque/classical/romantic repertoire, I've not really learned much more recent music. 

As a composition student, I'd love to get into more modern works for violin, but I don't really know where to start. It's obviously mostly not in the public domain, and a lot of ""significant"" post romantic through modern composers wrote violin music that's simply above my abilities to play (especially with my limited practice time).

For reference- before I started practicing less (around September), I'd been learning the Bach E major partita, the 1st movement of Bruch, Beethoven's 1st sonata, and Amy Beach's Romance (btw, check this piece out if you haven't heard it, it is lovely), and I'd recently finished learning Vivaldi's Summer, Mozart 3, and Kreisler Praeludium and Allegro.

I don’t have a tutor, and the audition requirements aren’t released until the first week on campus this fall. I’d like to have someone to at least help me learn some nice solos and improve my technique, but don’t know if the money is worth it (more so doable) given my financial circumstances.

I started playing the violin in the school orchestra my fifth grade year and joined a youth orchestra in high school, but never had a tutor growing up; the only times I did was on a handful of occasions during high school to help with regional and youth orchestra audition material, most being provided by the school. My youth orchestra peers have competed at many competitions and always have multiple concertos they could pull out on demand, and it makes me doubt my violin journey. I’ve played pieces like Les Preludes, Russian Easter, and Tchaikovsky’s Romeo and Juliet, and we’re in the same orchestras, but I can’t even figure out how to use the Carl Flesh Scales book properly.

Everything started after I had some dental work done in the molar or rather, had my treatment delayed for about three weeks between covid and waiting for the prosthesis to arrive. Then the buzz started started. I finished the treatment, waited some weeks, nothing happened, still had the buzz, went back to the dentist and we ran through everything we could and I really believe she's done everything she could, she says it is fine on her end.

Meanwhile, I went to two otolaryngologists, they couldn't find anything wrong, I ran the audiometry tests without any noticeable hearing loss. Even though, my buzz in the left ear still persists, it is more noticeable when I lie down to sleep and after I play the violin, it SEEMS it gets louder, though I'm not really sure if it's only my perception at the time. I feel my left ear is more ""delicate"" and it gets uncomfortable a lot easier with loud sounds. Both otolaryngologists mentioned it could be some kind of TMJ disorder, I want to know if anyone has went through this and have some kind of advice, I'm trying to find a TMJ specialist but things are about to get expensive, I'd love to hear some input from someone, even if it's happened to someone in their school/college.

Everything I find online when I look this up is some very inconclusive academic papers that barely include this as a factor, no forum posts. Usually tinnitus and buzzing are related with playing very loud violins for a long period of time. I'm quite sure this is not the case, because I always use either an artino mute or ear plugs and as a beginner I rarely go beyond two hours of playing/practice.

My violin teacher doesn't seem to find that I do anything wrong in my posture, I've tried different chin rests and shoulder rests meanwhile, the problem is that I'm 1.94cm (6""4' in imperial) with a long neck, so trying to find the correct setup is a bit hard to me, my teacher specializes in children so I think my anatomy is a bit out of what she sees everyday. I'm current using a bonmusica with a 50mm feet on the top and a 50mm on the bottom and a chinrest that looks like a dresden with three 2mm cork on the bottom I've tried central chinrests and guarneris, seems to fit better.

A couple of weeks ago my instrument (~200$, default strings) went out of tune so I started messing with pegs and broke the string. I changed all strings and got rid of the old ones. The new ones I got are Dogal Green Tag (less than 20$). I got them because I was told in the store that they are cheap but would make a good sound.

Since then (it's been around 2 weeks) my tone quality is terrible (maybe apart from the E string). I blame the strings but maybe am wrong about it. The sound is scratchy, dry. It's the worst when I play in 3rd position. It sometimes ceases when I rosin my bow like crazy, then the sound goes back to terrible after a minute or so of playing. What I noticed is that the strings are really soft compared to the old ones. And the G string in vibrates too much. It feels like it's too loose, but it's tuned well.

Leading up to this, I spent several Saturdays in a local violin shop playing through their collection and taking out trials from them also.

My first teacher played really well but had zero teaching experience, and as a result, could not point out key mistakes in my technique and posture. When I started practising alone in front of the mirror I could see some glaring mistakes, things I observed from watching youtube videos (Eddy!). Since he never pointed these things out for more than a year, I lost confidence and quit. 

Then due to Covid, I started virtual lessons. Did not go well. The teacher could hardly see my full posture and could not give me a lot of specific technical advice. Simply saying relax your shoulders can only go so far. There were some more experiences with teachers in between. 

Bottom line -  I have now been playing for about 3 years, still can't downbow without shaking and **desperately looking for in-person lessons in Bangalore. Any recommendations would be highly appreciated.**

I'm new to classical music. I only listen to recordings on youtube. Through interviews and being in the classical music community online, there's always ranking on musicians and who's better than who. I know that there's two things about a musical performer; there skills and, their music taste, which is subjective. There's popular musicians which are well liked and are seen as better than others, they even do this to the well known composers in classical music. There's Liszt vs Chopin, and so forth. In the comment sections on youtube, even on reddit, of a video with a musical prodigy performing, there's a sense of idolizing that person while downplaying your achievements. Prodigies and well known musical performers are seen as better than other musicians. I don't understand why even in arts, there's comkpetition. If music is subjective, why compare? And are these well liked musicians (e.g. hilary hahn) actually better than everyone? Shouldn't their taste be equal as anyone else? I know that I should only focus on the music and not compare myself to others but I don't want to go into music and always know that my music will never be as good as that other musician, or no matter how long I study music I will never become as skilled as another musician due to me starting late or having bad genetics.

So I finally decided to commit to the violin, I couldn't practice at home as I live in a flat, and as it is getting sunny, I decided to kill people with scratchy open strings, despite the shame it might bring upon me.
 
Yet sometimes it gets a little hard to walk out and carry this idea out, sometimes I might be afraid that the weather turns bad. I heard there are some way to muffle the sound but is it really good? Does it have important drawbacks that could hurt the practice as a beginner not aware of intonations and notes? 

Second question is about the shoulder rest. As I have taken no lessons so far (I should have but Covid decided otherwise and I don't know how those online lessons with people work for violin and posture check/bow hold, does it work or does it have to be more ""physical"" ?) I am not really sure it is setup properly and might actually hurt my progress by taking from the start bad posture habits.

That and the bow hold are still things I struggle with. I'll try to add some photos tomorrow if I can, so it might be clearer, but despite all the videos I saw, I still struggle to hold it properly. It seems so easy when people do it, they just take it like you would take a piece of bread, yet I still fight to even place my fingers on it. Then either my thumb or my pinkie, most likely both of them are incredibly tensed and straightened. And I can't find a way to correct it. I tried moving my wrist and fingers a bit but then I feel like I'm not holding it at all and it just wiggles in a weird way.

Any advice would be great :)",violinist,My G string keeps buzzing
1054,Music Major,1614193182,lrkilf,"I've posted here a few times about this job but I think I'm pretty close to landing it!

And to sweeten the deal even more I'm replacing a teacher who is moving on, so I should start with at least a few students!

They would be starting me part time, which is totally fine, I'm just curious about your experiences. Does it ever build up to be full time or is it just always going to be a side gig? If it did fill up for you, how long did it take , and how did you support yourself in the meantime?

I graduated with a BMus in Composition in May, and everything had hit the fan by then, so I haven't tried freelance performing or teaching or actually composing for money, I just don't think it's a possibility with the pandemic, especially not for someone who just graduated.

I took a 1099 field service IT technician job a few weeks before this music school showed interest in me. It's fine in theory but 1. They hired me expecting full time and 2. I was actually supposed to start taking tickets last week but there are some problems with the distributor or something, so I haven't had a single ticket yet (and have thus made 0 dollars). 

I love to play in orchestras but I was an adult beginner before undergrad so I don't think I'm quite good enough to get paid to do that. I would totally freelance doing weddings and events, though!

I have a few ideas but I'm struggling to pick between them. My other interest obviously is tech stuff, and I would do IT, but I had a really bad experience doing help desk, which makes me scared to go down that path. I'm just couldn't handle the corporate and cubicle type of environment, so I quit.

Before I got this lead, I was going to do WGU for CS during whatever downtime I had between field service calls. I was thinking CS because all of the typical IT positions I looked at seemed like they would be the same depressing call-centery vibe. 

But working through the process for this teaching job made me realize just how much I *don't* want to do that. What I really want to do is go get my Doctorate and teach undergraduate music theory. But I'm worried about being caught out with nothing capitalism decides is ""valuable"" when SHTF again.

I'd rather do music than code, but I'd rather code than be homeless, you know?

What should I do? Should I try to keep a tech related second job, since that's my other possible career path? Or, since I'm getting what I've always wanted, should I just take a job waiting tables or delivering food, because that's more likely to pay more? Should I go back to school and get a STEM degree as a backup plan, in case things worsen and teaching isn't viable anymore?",violinist,"1099 Teaching positions, does it ever become full time? What other work did you do to fill out your schedule?"

1056,,1614190649,lrji5w,"Hey yall. Found this on reddit https://phidler.com/strings/FleschFingerings.pdf

And I'm trying to start using it to practice, but I'm a little confused on notation.

First impression is that 2--1 2 3 means to shift to second hand position then play 1st 2nd 3rd notes. Makes sense.

I'm confused about 2 things: first, if that's right then a lot of scales leap from 2--3, second hand 3rd note, all the way to 4--4 and then back. Isnt that a much bigger interval than a semi or whole tone, as you'd expect in a scale? Am I reading it right in thinking it's 4th position 4th finger?

Secondly what the heck does 4--4--4 mean??

Thank you for your time",violinist,Please help reading this Fleisch scale/notation

It's a twitch clip because I stream a lot (not relevant) but a few viewers insist on seeing my progress so I figured I'd occasionally stream practice sessions for the internet to... endure.

Worth noting that I'm roughly 80% focused on reading the music itself and translating it in my head into what to actually do here. I could probably play a little better if I knew the entire song already.

Things to note: The violin cost me roughly $60, I'm fairly certain the bow itself is crap in more ways than one because it doesn't actually bend inwards towards the hair, it only stretches itself further away like a... bow and arrow bow. Some of the notes I try and play always sound off compared to any other video I look up, which I'm not sure if its because of me, bow, violin, rosin, strings, or most likely a combination of all of them.

I'm trying though!",violinist,Feedback on clip of one month being self taught?
