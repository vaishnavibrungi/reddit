Anyway, I dropped out of my bachelor of performance degree back in college, and now, years later, I would like to make a smaller, but still performance-oriented goal for myself, and this seems to fit the bill.  I learned that the ABRSM exams are open to all ages (great!), are available in the USA, and that you have to pass the theory level 5 before going to higher levels.  Agreed?  

Here are my questions....

1. do the syllabus piece-lists stay the same year-to-year?  In other words, if I begin learning a piece and it takes me more than a year to want to go to exam with it, is there a risk the piece will have fallen off the list?
2. what's the difference between ""practical"" exams and ""performance"" exams?  I just don't get it.
3. Is there a website where you can brush up the theory online?  Are there special ABRSM books you can buy?
4. If you pass the level 8 exam, is there a higher level you can go to after that?

We were all really nervous and messed up one piece pretty badly in a really, really obvious and public way!

That one was pretty painful for about 90 seconds. But the audience was still supportive, and we played some some other pieces really well.

1) Get comfortable playing in random, strange chairs. You never know what the venue will provide.

37,,1623067109,nuamp9,"Following this topic that I made https://www.reddit.com/r/Cello/comments/gv3axd/wobbly_endpin/

I decided to change the entier endpin system because in addition to the wobbling from low quality CF shaft, the screw just wasn't working anymore, the whole thing was very bad quality imo.

So I asked to have a steel endpin, just a regular classical endpin that work well and is reliable. I ended with a Weidler steel endpin which work very well, no wobbling, great stability BUT ! Something has changed, in a positive manner !

The cello has always been hard to play, bad response time, I have to work very hard on the bow to make it speak and I never can rely on the instrument, very frustrating, with some strange sound effect on double strings (wolf-like on double stopped harmonics, weird...). 

All of this was solved by the new steel endpin ! I'm just blown away, I never imagined that the CF endpin was the problem for the bad response of the cello. Of course, good CF engine work well, so I'm guessing my CF endpin was really really bad... 

What is your guess about that ? The old CF endpin was absorbing too much from the cello, dampening it ? Also, the luthier had to drill a larger hole for the new endpin system, maybe this as some effect ?

PS: every other things are well set because in my attempt to solve the response problems I had made 2 setup by 2 different luthier to see the effect, so bridge and soundpoast are well set.",Cello,Endpin change - response and resonance

41,,1622903933,nsx59j,"Hi! I help my son with cello stuff. Time flies, and he has had the same set of strings for 2 years! At a summer mini-camp, an instructor gave some indiv feedback, including that his A string could be brighter. Current strings are Kaplan daddario medium. This cello is a wide-body, so it does favor the lower tones. The Kaplan strings are fine, except I am wondering if a different A, to be brighter, would help. Such as Pirazzi Gold. Or, might he merely need new strings.

Also, he does find playing on the high end of the A string to be challenging. It seems like getting a light versus medium gauge string would help. But then, that is moving to weaker sound versus stronger.

But if he had a great, pricey A string, that might overcome the relative weakness of a light gauge string. Is he more at risk of A string breaking if he gets a high quality light gauge string?

I guess I am hoping that spending more money will solve all problems: risk of string breaking, strong bright lead tone, and ease of playing high on the fingerboard. Will money solve all problems? Or at least this one?

Basically, it's a series of fast, strummed, pizzicato triple stops that could in theory be played by a single cello (by an ultra-virtuoso), but I've split them into 2 parts to make it simpler. I took the this idea from Debussy's Ibéria.

I have 2 questions because it's not completely like Debussy's example:

1. Even if simplified, each player still needs to change back-and-forth between 2 chords. This chord voicing (root, 5th ,10th) requires barring all the strings with the index finger, would making this so many times become too tiring?

2. In theory pizzicati not involving open strings decay very fast (people say l.v. ties in this case are meaningless), but even considering this, would 1 cello playing a chord and the other playing the next one cause excessive blurring? Think of it as in not lifting the piano's damper pedal.

69,Student,1622314974,nnu1zl,"Hello everyone.

Today while I was practicing, the thought of upgrading from my student cello struck me. This has never happened to me, since my student cello is of a pretty decent quality (it costs 1.200 euro and it is a  rented instrument, just for the record).

I have been studying for a little over a year and a half, practicing diligently every day. I am very driven, and I have the best teacher ever, so I have been seeing a bit of progress in my technique. I am aware of the fact that technique and practicing is everything, and that you should not focusing on getting a better instrument because at the beginning, you would see little difference in upgrading to a better cello. 

My thoughts on upgrading started a couple months ago, but today while practicing these thoughts became more clear, as I have pieces that I have been perfecting for months, and I have started to notice that my sound differs just ever so slightly from the sound of my recording in some parts. I remember that, when I first went to my local luthier to get my first cello ever, the one I have right now, i could barely notice any difference on the sound of the instruments I got to choose from, so I chose mine because I liked the colour of the wood (please don’t judge me).

It is also worth mentioning that I am super attached to my rental cello, she has been with me since the beginning of this wonderful adventure and therefore she has emotional value. I doubt I can ever get rid of her. Do you also have special attachments to your instruments or am I just crazy?

In brief; Of course, I don’t have the need of going out and buying a super expensive instrument right now, I am more interested in hearing your experiences about this; what was the thing that made you realise you needed an upgrade? I am genuinely interested in how this happened for other people, since it feels like it’s a bit of a rite of passage for me. What an interesting feeling!

Thanks for taking the time to read this.",Cello,When did you feel the need of getting a better cello as a student?
70,,1622247170,nnb9sm,"I'm an adult learner, at the early intermediate stage. I've been wanting to experiment with different types of strings, but of course that's an expensive proposition! Today I got (and installed) an Evah Pirazzi Gold A string. I've played on it for about an hour and am pretty intrigued.  I like its responsiveness-- it activates with a very light touch, and it's my understanding that's one of the primary characteristics of Evah Pirazzi strings. But at this point I don't know whether I should should purchase D, G, and/or C strings, as well. 

Does anyone here use Evah Pirazzi strings? If so, do you use a full set? Just A and D? What do you like/dislike about them?

Maybe this topic was already mentioned in this subreddit but I would like to know some tips to get finger dexterity/agility but without tension.

75,,1622206047,nmx34e,"Our next meetup will be **this Saturday, again at 8 PM Scottish time (BST).** For those that haven't joined before: **Our meetups are supposed to be fun and super-casual.** Those that want to play and share some of the music they are currently working on, are welcome to do so. Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your Reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

100,,1621596186,nhq4js,"I'm a beginner and have only played for 2-3 weeks and my greatest bane has been the cello bow hold. Ive watched a lot of YT vids on the bow hold and many talked about having a loose hold, or even innovate based on that principal of looseness but I just can't get that looseness down, especially since my thumb feels like it's overcompensating, especially when I reach the end of the bow for a longer stroke and wrist bends inwards. I end up adjusting a lot while playing and all the sounds a produce sounds like nails on a chalkboard. Rosin is not an issue since I scrub it like erasing an erotic drawing on my exam OAS paper. Sometimes I'm not even sure when my pinky is supposed to rest, and I can't pronate my pinky. And even when I pronate my index finger (unintentionally for the most part), my thumb will lock a lot. Is there a golden standard for holding the bow? Like did any of you guys experienced a epiphany in bow holding like some spiritual awakening moment for bowing, or really anything that's useful to constructing a solid bow hold.

Finger span is another issue, for example playing C, D, E with 1,2,4 as finger numbers respectively, has been a challenge for me to learn and do it in correct intonation, even now and then I cannot do it.

128,,1621066590,nctvt5,"Hello,

I just upgraded my bow for the first time ('Alfred Knoll 304C', Pernambuco, CA$800), and need advice on if I should keep it or return it.

I was upgrading to eventually play more advanced pieces (Schumann, Elgar, etc.)--the new bow is very responsive &amp; light, and makes string crossings much easier. However, I find it's also hard to really ""dig"" into the strings with it. This causes my cello to project less, and makes it tough to play varied dynamics/sforzandos/spiccatos. 

There is also a weird vibration below my right index/middle fingers sometimes as I am playing--briefly feels like the bow will come apart between the wire coils and the leather grip. The bow also needs to be screwed almost completely to be tightened enough (i.e. stick not touching the hair).

I really like the tone the bow produces (richer and clearer notes), so I want to make this bow work. But I am not sure if the issues I am experiencing are beyond the normal new-bow-adjustment pains. Could someone please suggest what I should do?

Thank you in advance!",Cello,New Bow Help
129,,1621059272,ncs7cp,"Hello! This is my first time buying a new bow, and I would really appreciate any piece of wisdom you could spare me!

I got a new $800 (CND) Pernambuco bow yesterday. My goal was finding a bow which would allow me to play more advanced repertoire (Elgar and Schumann Concertos, etc.).

The new bow feels extremely responsive and light. It's more tip-heavy than my old bow, and I can play string crossings with it much more smoothly. It also really enhances the tone of the cello--makes all the notes sound more ""focused"" (albeit a bit too bright). In the music store, it also produced really beautiful legatos, which made playing the Swan lake and other slow melodies an absolute pleasure.

But when I tried the bow again at home, I realized the legatos don't ""sing"" as much. Also, the balance of the bow is completely different from my old bow, and I am having difficulty ""digging"" into the strings. This causes my cello to project less, and the dynamics/sforzandos/spiccatos of my playing are really suffering. My body must have done something to try to compensate for it, because my right shoulder started hurting after playing with the new bow for about 1.5 hours. 

Also, I think there may be structural problems with the new bow-- I need to turn the screw almost the entire way to tighten the bow enough, and sometimes I feel a weird vibration from where the coil meets the leather grip on the bow. (My old bow never had these problems(?) so I don't know if these are normal or not.)

I really like the tonal quality the bow produces, and want to make it work; but it's really disheartening to hear my playing sound so boring all of sudden. I was wondering if someone could please tell me if it's:

1) normal to have such a tough adjustment period after buying a new bow? (Especially when going from a cheap student bow to a better bow)

2) normal for bows to have the above-mentioned structural quirks?

135,,1620930020,nbneuk,"Hey guys,

Adult beginning cellist here with some troubles regarding technique, so my teachers advice has given me thankfully now healed tendonitis, by keeping my 4 fingers uncomforrably spread wide to be in tune all the time during every key/position on all four fingers. It took around 1 month to heal my arm and the pain was SEVERE.
During that time I have began watching slowed down videos of cellists analysing professional technique, and I see them quite often very subtly slide up or down a bit on the fingerboard to reach notes especially when going from fourth to the lower second finger, I also notice when people go from the first to the third finger their second finger stays very close to the third and is in no way perfectly in tune when so close to the third finger.

I have for now taken a break from this teacher due to this conflict,  as I have had trouble going from the fourth to second lower finger for ages despite stretching finger exercises. There is a lot more flexibility between my fingers yes but not in the way that all my 4 fingers are perfectly in tune in all keys. With a f or c sharp the second finger is always too low, and with flats it is vice versa.
I have resolved this issue now simply by sliding the hand just a bit up, and am now perfectly in tune all the time playing like this.
However my teacher keeps insisting it is necessary to have the finger spaced perfectly all the time in tune no matter what. But I find this impossible , and as far as I can tell on YouTube from other cellist nobody is actually doing that, and lots of subtle up and down movements happen to reach a note in tune. 


I am conflicted now and thinking of switching teachers, but I wonder now what the general outlook on this is. Cause I know I will never be able to play comfortable like the way my teacher wants me too, but it bothers me that I am also now perhaps using ""improper"" techniques.",Cello,Are your 4 fingers really supposed to be in tune in all keys on the fingerboard?

&amp;#x200B;

Hey r/cello!

For background, I'm a violinist who learned the double bass (mostly) by myself. The next step in my mind was to teach myself the cello, so I went ahead and bought [this](https://www.musicarts.com/cremona-sc-500-premier-artist-cello-outfit-main0379919#!#full-description) cello off the Music &amp; Arts website for $1000 back in 2020 (huge mistake, as you can probably guess lol.)

I get the cello and sound... well, bad. Even open strings sound scratchy, especially the D string. I played around with a few of my friends' cellos and sounded decent, which I think ruled out my playing as the issue. I made sure my bow was properly rosined and even tried on a set of nicer strings, but the sound was still all scratchy. 

... Then I realize that my cello doesn't even have a sound post, and a crack is starting to form out of one of the F-holes because the front face of the cello is caving (this was already months into the purchase, so returning wasn't an option). I take it to a luthier and as soon as he lays eyes on it, he tells me I have a shitty cello that's worth $200, tops (I'm inclined to believe him because he made my violin and has my violin coach's recommendation\*). He also said he could install the sound post and fix the crack for $60 or completely revamp the cello for \~$800, but in the moment I decided I didn't want to sink any more money into a shitty instrument.

So now I'm stuck with an overpriced, damaged cello I don't really want. And I apologize if this came off like a rant LOL. My question is... could the lack of a sound post be the cause of the scratchiness, or is it more likely just the cello itself? If it's the latter I'll probably try my hand at consigning or selling it.

146,,1620786855,naeeyw,"Hopefully this Dropbox link works, and hopefully some of you will enjoy playing this music. That's why I've dropped it in here! 

I'm currently working on a new piece to help some of my students. This piece is aimed at three areas of technique: intonation, double stopping to back up the intonation work, and left hand positions 1 through to 5.

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/vic1hjk8k8jl1na/Song%20Without%20Words%20Cello%20Part.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vic1hjk8k8jl1na/Song%20Without%20Words%20Cello%20Part.pdf?dl=0)

To explain, I've been focussing a lot recently on tonalisation and using the overtones/harmonics on each string to help them ensure good intonation. Basically I work with my students to let the cello help them play in tune. This piece is centred around A minor / C major, with plenty of notes that will draw extra resonance out of the cello when they are perfectly in tune. 

Added to that, the double stopped section can be used to work further on listening and adjusting intonation. 

There is a lot of shifting, mostly playing in blocks, targeting good use of positions. We have plenty of extended position as well as closed position.  

It's in 3/4 time. There's also an opportunity to work on the bowing arm for good expressive technique, string crossings and the chance to work on a gentle hook stroke (ternary) in places. 

Please let me know what you think of it. It will be published with piano accompaniment, guitar chords (all my cello pieces are intended to be played with a band, even my sonatas), and a trainer that breaks up the sections to help learn them, highlighting the various techniques we are working on. Hopefully you like it as much as I do.

Took a bit of a break from volunteer lessons while I finished up my finals, but we're back at it!

I’m an undergraduate Performance major looking to get more volunteer teaching experience. I noticed that a lot of people on the sub are having trouble finding private teachers (especially ones that they can afford because professionals are very expensive). At the same time, my studio has a few spots open. So, for the next four weeks, I wanted to offer some free half-hour Zoom lessons to any interested cellists at the beginner or intermediate level.

What we work on in those few weeks is entirely up to your needs—we can do solo repertoire, scales, orchestra music, or whatever you would find it most helpful to work on/have an introduction to. (Even if you wanna just ask a few personalized technical questions, I’d be happy to assist!) In the absence of any prepared repertoire, I can recommend some things befitting your level of experience.

I won’t put my full bio here, but I’ve been teaching for three years (one of those years fully online). As a student myself, I went to All-State Orchestra, graduated from some fairly renowned summer institutes, was principal in all my youth orchestras, and got a fellowship at my current university. (I’m a serious student cellist who’s also very serious about teaching! Just hoping I can be of service to the general cello-ing community. And, of course, it's nice getting volunteer hours while meeting other cool musicians.)

If you’re interested or want to know more about me, feel free to send a DM! In terms of scheduling, I'll give priority to those who can do weekdays (at any time), since that's when the bulk of my free time is right now.

This is a summary of my full article, which I'll put below shortly. I hope all this is helpful. 

As cellists we can spend a lot of money trying to find the best string solutions for our specific needs. I had sort of bypassed Jargar (except for Jargar Superior, which I really do like!) in the last several years because I had been finding too many cellos where the Jargar Medium set just didn't do the best job. In my research for our blogpost, I found out a stack of information I'd not previously considered: In their standard range, Jargar makes a whole variety of options that you can mix and match if needed, to get that required balance on your cello for a much more reasonable price.

I was wondering if anyone has found they had to switch from a 4/4 to 7/8 cello due to hand size and strain.

I’m aware that there will always be a slight disadvantage with sound quality, though I’m mostly playing for myself so this isn’t a huge concern. I’m more interested if it will have any advantage for more advanced techniques down the road and prevent injury in the coming decades. 

Very soon I’ll try to rent an Eastman 7/8 student cello and depending how things are going in a few months I’ll invest in a better quality instrument.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached.

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

I've been playing the piano for a few years now and there are many pieces I play that are accompanied by the cello and the cello bits always give me goosebumps, not the piano parts :)   
I also got hooked by the cello from some scenes in Airwolf which is a childhood favorite series about a high tech helicopter :) 

Anyway, I'm planning on starting with a teacher in September in my local music school where I currently follow piano and composition. I will stop with piano in favor of the cello. 

I have a good job so money isn't really an issue. I checked online and I think the budget I can use for a cello is up to 2000 euro.  I'm from Belgium so if some of you could provide some advise on where or what to buy in that price range, that would be awesome.   
I know many people start with renting one but because I feel so strongly about the cello for so long, I don't think I will not like it :) Also because I have experience with both piano and guitar, I believe I have sufficient musical background to understand what I will put myself into. 

Because the lessons will start in September (start of new school year), I am wondering if I best wait to buy a cello in August and don't touch it until my lessons. I know if I go buy it now I will be to eager not to touch it.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I'm a new member to the subreddit so if there are any mistakes in my post or sources I can refer to such as a subreddit wiki, please point me in the right direction.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, onto the topic of this post. I've been playing cello for around 5 1/2 years, and recently moved from Massachusetts to Korea. I used to play a rental that I enjoyed for its smooth, even tone and decent projection. It was from Johnson Strings, and I think it was from Eastman. As I was moving internationally, I decided to return the rental to Johnsons, and look for a new cello to use in Korea. Unfortunately, when I first arrived and started looking for options, things didn't seem to be up to standard. Most cellos I saw had a muffled tone, poor wood quality, tone, and strings were too high off the bridge. Pegs and fingerboards also seemed to be painted black instead of being genuine ebony, and no one really had any higher end cellos than the aforementioned starter ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, I've been considering ordering online from a reputable cello dealer to get something like a Jay Haide a l'ancienne of the ruggieri variant, or a Snow SC200 kind of thing. However, I'm rather anxious about not being able to try it out in person. Do you guys think it's better to keep searching around for a local luthier and shop? Or is it better to get a cello online. If so, are there any models you guys would recommend, or sites to order from?

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.

TLDR: Church Music good for practice - better than etude - claims Bach fanboi

I just wanted to give all you budding cellists looking for some good material to sink your teeth into a little tip which have enormously helped me in my journey (I've been playing for about a year and a half now).

If you find yourself a little bored with Dotzauer and Popper, which I admit on occasion I have, and want something that is moderately easy to play, yet sounds good, I would suggest a little foray into (hold on to your bows) ...church music!

No matter what your religious stance might be, there is no denying that there is a well of beautiful music written for the church through the ages. And, luckily for all beginners, it exists at all levels of complexity and difficulty. Bach alone wrote over 250 cantatas, for instance, and a lot of them have been preserved. Moreover, some of the most popular and, dare I say, beautiful pieces have been arranged for the cello (as well as for other instruments).

To illustrate, let me just point you to one of my favorites: ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring"", derived from a chorale part of the Cantata ""Heart and Mouth and Deed and Life"" by J.S. Bach (BWV 147). 

Now, maybe a lot of you are quite familiar with this, but I must admit I was not until I, rather randomly, came across an arrangement for Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring for the cello (Link to some free sheet music to try below).

It is a stunningly beautiful piece, and was (to me at least) a welcome break from Sensei Suzuki and Hr. Dotzauer. And, although it has some shifts into higher positions, it is not all that difficult to play. 

I will admit to playing this piece for hours and it is such a beautiful little gem - almost meditative. You can also practice your vibrato on the melody parts, which is an added bonus. (If you struggle with vibrato, you can always claim you don't want to use vibrato because it is a Baroque piece when performing for friends and family, so a win-win there also ;-D)

Better still, you get to play something that is pretty sweet on the ears and practice some position shifts and vibrato at the same time. And you get just a little bit familiar with Bach which might come in handy later if you are eyeing the Cello Suites, for instance.

I am a total Bach fanboi, so if you absolutely hate Bach, then the piece below maybe might not be for you. There is, however, a lot of other pieces out there written for (or adapted by) the church into hymns you can explore. Everything from Händel to traditional music, and a lot of it is easily available.

This turned into a rant, and I apologize.

Here is a link to a free cello arrangement for Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring:

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

I am a beginning-ish violin player with around 3 years of experience.  I am not terribly good, but at my best was at least working on things like the Vivaldi concerto in A minor.  I have developed an elbow problem that might necessitate ""retiring"" from the instrument.  In a nutshell, if I extend my elbow fully or nearly so and rotate my wrist heavily towards the thumb side (as when bowing down towards the tip of the bow), a tendon snaps over a nerve in my elbow and hurts like crazy and does the nerve no good at all.

I am going to try a 3/4 bow and see if that helps, but it was also suggested that I consider a different instrument.  Piano was the first suggested, but a violist friend also mentioned cello.  Cello sounds more appealing on face, as I had considered it when I started taking music lessons and I am supposing that some of what I currently know might translate.

So my question is this, especially for anyone with experience with both instruments: is the bowing motion for cello likely to result in the same position of my arm/elbow (extended at the elbow and pronated at the wrist and forearm the same time)?  This is purely a hobby of mine and I don't want to screw up that nerve, nor pick something else up and discover that I can't do it when the material gets remotely challenging.

People go on vacation, spring sports start up, people just want to take a break, etc etc. In this case things are opening back up here in the states so people might suddenly find they don't have the time to take lessons. Nice parents/students phase you out and let you know in advance but a surprising amount of people will just hit you with ""This is Jonny's last lesson, he is going to be doing \[insert sport here\] and we just don't have the time!"" and then you are out that money. 

&amp;#x200B;

So just a little cautionary bit of advice here for everyone who has started making money teaching, Plan on your students all staying with you, but also don't quit your day job if you know what I mean. It's hard to find new students in the summer so hold onto the ones you have and save your pennies, it will open back up in september when people get back to school. 

&amp;#x200B;

good luck everyone!",Cello,"For all the new teachers out there, the dry season is approaching."
267,,1618689952,msy0h3,I already posted about this but then stopped worrying about it because I thought I figured out the problem but I actually hadn’t so here I am again. I’m still in high school so I have a cello at school and at home as well. My cello at school is great and the bow I use is great and I really enjoy playing it. But when I play on the cello at home it feels and sounds really bad and I think it’s because of the bow but I can’t be too sure. My bow is tightened but still feels like I have to press really hard on the g and c strings. It’s so annoyingggg and the notes don’t sound clear at all and slur string crossings are a nightmare. #sickofitplshelp bc idk what the problem is. 😭,Cello,Extremely irritated please help

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.

304,,1617759293,mlr6i8,"Hello,

I'm a casual amateur player, but I plan on trying out for a higher-level community orchestra once the pandemic is over. I've played cello on and off since mid-2000's, and finished RCM 10 in 2013 (played St. Saens Concerto No.1). My ultimate music goal is to be able to play difficult cello pieces with ease.

My current cello is worth around $2.5k and has decent projection. My cello teachers said that it sounded good enough for the RCM exams and student honour orchestras.

My current bow is the one that came with the cello, and it's beginning to show a lot of wear and tear.

Because I have just finished my university degree, I have very little disposable income to spend on my instrument. I currently have the following problems:

1. The bow's wires are partially corroded, and there's a slight dip on the stick where I place my thumb (because I used to be a very tense player). There's an uneven distribution of bow hair tension (slacker hair towards the thumb side (vs the side with other fingers)). When I got it rehaired a few years ago, they told me it may be more cost-efficient to get a new bow instead.
2. My D string buzzes, which I believe is because the groove on the nut is too big for the string.
3. I feel like it takes too much energy to get my bows going from full stop. I am not sure if this is because of aging strings (a few years old...I should really switch them out!) or because the bowhair's worn out. Rosining the bow more doesn't seem to help.
4. It's harder to vary dynamics/do different bowing techniques on my cello compared to the $4k ones they had on display at a music store.
5. My cello's got a lot of little scratches because I was very clumsy as a teenager.

I am currently planning on getting a new bow, a new set of strings and possibly a new nut. However, I recently read/heard on online forums that people tend to upgrade their instruments for ones that cost about $5k (or more) at my level, and I am wondering if I should be saving up to get a new instrument instead.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

352,,1616893778,mer9h2,"Hello everyone, I need some advice for my future.

I’m currently a senior in highschool, and I’m about to head off to my first semester of college in the fall. I am still waiting for a few college decisions, but I will most likely attend the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA (it’s the best college I've been accepted to so far). I tried applying for a few music schools/majors, but with asian parents, it has never been my intention to actually pursue music by itself. My goal was to double major in cello performance and economics/business, and my parents allowed that.

Music wise, I am a very passionate cellist. I have taken private lessons for almost 8 years, attended a summer festival, won a few competitions, and applied to a few music schools and conservatories. I am due to perform a solo debut concert of the Shostakovich Cello Concerto with the Augusta Symphony in May and soon recording Dvorak’s Cello Concerto Mvt.1 for a performance for Carnegie Hall. I am quite confident in my abilities, and I wish to continue improving and exploring cello performance in college. I’m no Juilliard or Curtis caliber musician, but I believe I could do great at a music school (say Eastman or Berkeley, still two great schools). However, I never really had the option to apply for all the music schools I wanted, because of my parents. So I took a shot at 2 schools, both which came back negative.

I want to continue pursuing music and cello performance in college, but GT simply does not have any music. It only has an orchestra. No faculty, no affiliated quartet or teachers, nothing that will really satisfy a passionate, competitive, and determined cellist.

So my question for you guys is, if I attend GT next fall, how would you all suggest that I continue pursuing music at a high level? If my school doesn't offer much, how do I continue my intensive studies independently? I know that I could also just continue what I’m currently doing in high school (taking private lessons, competing in private competitions, audition for summer festivals, etc.) but I really wanted to be in a college that has those opportunities for me. 

Much appreciated. Thank you!

353,,1616876646,meluvf,"Listening to youtube videos of Vocalise on the cello, I find about 50/50 between being played in the original C#minor (there's a Yo Yo Ma and a Rostropovich, for example) and in Eminor.  Yet the cello scores are all in Em. In the original key, Ma was able to play the repeats an octave higher

The cause seems obvious: when playing, with or without vibrato, on another finger, the first finger is not in a position where it can strike the fingerboard perpendicularly - it is tilted back towards the scroll. (I play with my other fingers pretty much perpendicular, as I was taught.) This causes quite a bit of awkwardness and delay in commencing vibrato - basically I am moving my thumb up to be directly opposite the index finger, rotating the hand so it's perpendicular, then starting.

Are there any hints for this situation, or non-obvious exercises? Or is it just a matter of practising playing something on another finger, then switching to one and trying to vibrate as quickly as possible?",Cello,Starting vibrato on first finger immediately after changing fingers
359,,1615939278,m6n42q,"Here are a few pro tips that can dramatically affect your performance.  

First if you are interested, check this website out for a more thorough understanding of how your cello works. https://www.aitchisoncellos.com/article-library/technical-articles-about-the-cello/

If you are not having a beautiful sound, or getting frustrated playing go to a luthier that works with professional musicians, not your local mom and pop luthier. Email a university with a string instrument department and email the professor to recommend a good luthier for you.

point 1: get bow rehaired every 6 months. The bow rehair is the difference between eyesight with glasses and eyesight without glasses.  The clarity of the instrument is greatly affected. It has something to do with ionic charge and its ability to attract the rosin. The bow works much better and you can put more of your heart into the instrument. 

point 2:  check for bridge warping.  If its warped, its best to get it dewarped.  it will affect the sound pretty moderately.Luthier can do this readily. 

point 3: check if their is air  you can see at the bridge feet.  if there is air you need to loosen the strings and flex the bridge back into the correct position.  If you are scared, get a luthier to do it and then show you how its done. 

point 4: soundpost  position:  If your instrument is not sounding good, the luthier can adjust your soundpost or  bridge and it should be less wolfy and more clear and resonant.  soundpost position is the touchstone of  a great playing sounding instrument and a poorly sounding instrument. Every instrument and how it sounds is beyond what modern computers and physics can predict.  Very subtle deviations can affect the whole instrument. 

point 5:  get new strings.  If you havent changed your strings in about 6 months to a year get new ones.  They are expensive but you want to reduce all sources of problems 



Final point:  use your cello to express your heart and soul.  If you had problems with your heart you would go to a Dr. If you had problems with your soul you would go to God.   If you have problems with your cello, since its a proxy for your heart and soul,  go to a good luthier. 

Good luck!",Cello,Luthier Protips

367,,1615763686,m56yqg,"Hi folks,

I'm a cellist and professional musician in Canada. I dislocated my finger in an accident one week ago, and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with recovery from an injury like this? I attached a photo of my x-ray for reference. The attending physician in the ER said that if I had ligament damage I could be referred to a surgeon, but she didn't indicate that there was that much damage. 

So far, I still have very limited mobility, and am unable to play. I have been icing daily, and wearing a splint, though I make sure to try and move my finger a little bit every day. It is still quite painful, and I don't want to push it. My range of motion right now allows my finger to fully straighten, though it is mildly painful, and I cannot make a fist. I can form a fist with all my other fingers, but my intermediate and distal phalanges extend outward about 45 degrees compared to their neighboring joints. Trying to move them further than this causes quite a bit of pain. There is a physiotherapist that is a hand specialist about 8 hours away from me, and I intend to see him as soon as possible (tough with Covid, but I am getting vaccinated this week).  

If anyone has any information or experience with this kind of injury I would be very grateful to hear it!

Thanks",Cello,Dislocated left hand middle finger
368,,1615757213,m54p25,"I’ve been playing for a while (since 6th grade) but was never that talented or competitive. I took a huge break and have started playing for fun recently. I’ve been using my mute because I’ve painfully shy, both with my neighbors when I lived in apartments and with my SO. But even when I have the chance to take it off I don’t like too. This was how it was even back in HS. I love my mute! It takes away the brassiness and I just play better because the tone sounds nicer and boosts my ego. 

Anyone knows if there’s something I can change to make my unmuted cello sound better? Or is this a common thing? 

A few likely culprits:
-strings are probably old af. I don’t know when most people replace them but they are easily 6 years old. I’ve recently read some people remove built up rosin from strings with an alcohol solution but I’ve never tried that. 
-my bowing. I’m sure it’s saw like and not nearly as precise as it should be
-my left hand. I’ve never seemed to be able to get that rich sound that other people get

My hands are extremely weak and I put most of the blame on them. Even when I was playing every day, RIP pinky if I tried vibrato. My fingers lock up like crazy, especially when they get tired, and often slip on strings. Same for my bowing hand. The OG advice I got was to hold the frog like a coke bottle.

Big fan of this community and how it helps anyone from each and every cello background!
I have had two issues lately and I wondered if somebody could help me with them.

The first issue is a maintenance problem. After each practice I always wipe the neck, the fretboard and the strings (and of course the bow). Yet it often feels yucky, sticky and unclean when I practice next day. I have the fortunate opportunity being able to practice each day, but I play a lot and this I sweat a lot.

The second problem I have is with the strings. About three months ago I bought new strings and was very happy. They sounded and felt great. Whenever I was done playing, one wipe and the resin disappeared from the strings. Then I played for a few weeks without wiping the fretboard or the the strings. As a result, it was incredibly hard to remove the solid resin from the strings and fretboard, but I eventually succeeded. Now however, the resin sticks to the strings really hard whenever I am done playing. It isn’t easily removed. I have tried cleaning the strings with alcohol, but it only had a short lasting effect. Now I spend a few minutes after each practice, slowly removing the resin from the strings.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached.

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

The repair cost was higher than the price of the instrument, so it went unfixed.   


Recently I've gotten a new instrument, but I'm wondering what to do with old one. It's been sitting in my parents' basement for 10 years.   


Should I try to get a third opinion on repair costs? Should I see if any shops would like to take it? Should I use it as decoration? I'm just looking for ideas and insight.

405,,1615238640,m0qip6,"Hi all, possibly a very silly question but I thought about it today and now I’m super worried. 
Here is the context: I have a rental cello since a couple of months. It’s nice enough but I’m definitely giving it back in summer. It is a relatively new cello from 2019 and it looks pristine so I suppose it’s not “played in” yet. At home I practice 100% with an Artino mute on, there is simply no other way as I live in an block of flats. I know it’s not optimal but it’s better than nothing. 

Now to my question - I remember seeing a YouTube video where a professional cellist was saying that a cello’s wooden body imprints the vibrations from the sounds played on it, and this is why good intonation is important not only for the obvious reasons of enjoyable music but also for the instrument in the long run. 

So today it suddenly hit me - what if I’m harming the cello by muting a good chunk of the frequency spectrum most of the time? 😱",Cello,Will my mute harm my rental cello?

I'm an adult cello learner; I've had quite some years of piano lessons as a kid. I've struggled with rhythm my whole life, the focus was always more on the melody in my piano lessons. 

Recently, I found the app Rhythm Trainer (available for iOs and Android) and it has been immensly helpful for training my sense of rhythm when reading scores. The app has 200andsomething excercises, ranging from beginner to expert. You can do 10 mins of free excercises a day - a perfect amount of daily training time if you ask me. 

But the best thing: it reacts to mistakes you make. If you struggle on a rhythm, it slows down the tempo for you and slowly builds it up again once you got the right rhythm. It tells you if you are rushing a rhythm and gives you visual clues on the mistakes you made. You can take a placement test so you don't have to start from the beginning if you are more advanced.

438,,1614213529,lrryhk,"Hi all. I am a beginner cellist and I bought a cello during quarantine which I played over the summer. Once I got back to school in the fall (current undergrad music major/violinist), I did not have time to practice at all. I am starting to get back into it now, however when I tried to tune it this evening, the pegs kept slipping. I first used the fine tuners to tune it since each string was only a half step or so flat.  Then the pegs began to slip. I probably need some peg compound on them, but do you think there could be any other damage to it from sitting idle for a few months?

As a music teacher I always wanted an easy way for my students to learn a bit more about music theory. So last year I started on a quest to make an app to allow exactly that.

You can:

* Learn music theory step by step (from basic naturals to intervals, chords/scales to progressions)
* Learn ear-training at the same time (optional)
* Read information in the in-app wiki
* Play any interval, chord, scale from any tonic in the playground

I'd love it if you guys try it and give me some feedback on what to improve. You can look on the [website](https://sonid.app/) and it is available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sonid/id1490221762?ls=1) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.stroopwafel.music.app).

445,,1614028550,lq05i2,"Hey cellists!

I’m an undergraduate Performance major looking to get more volunteer teaching experience. I noticed that a lot of people on the sub are having trouble finding private teachers (especially ones that they can afford because professionals are very expensive). At the same time, my studio has a few spots open. So, through the month of March, I wanted to offer some free half-hour Zoom lessons to any interested cellists at the beginner or intermediate level.

What we work on in those few weeks is entirely up to your needs--we can do solo repertoire, scales, orchestra music, or whatever you would find it most helpful to work on/have an introduction to. (Even if you wanna just ask a few personalized technical questions, I’d be happy to assist!) In the absence of any prepared repertoire, I can recommend some things befitting your level of experience.

I won’t put my full bio here, but I’ve been teaching for three years (one of those years fully online). As a student myself, I went to All-State Orchestra, graduated from some fairly renowned summer institutes, was principal in all my youth orchestras, and got a fellowship at my current university. (I’m a serious student cellist who’s also very serious about teaching! Just hoping I can be of service to the general cello-ing community. And, of course, it's nice getting volunteer hours while meeting other cool musicians!)

If you’re interested or want to know more about me, feel free to send a DM! I can take probably a maximum of eight students this month, but if more are interested, I’ll happily do this again in April and maybe beyond. Hope I can help with some of your music!",Cello,Free lessons from performance undergrad through March!
446,,1614022384,lpxjjo,"Hi everyone, this post is not so much a question but a couple observations, although of course comments are very welcome. 

1) I have a wold of F, a wolf-killer solves the problem well when I play without a mute (which is only when I'm at my teacher's studio). I have an Artino mute and it seems to bring some ""wolfiness"" back. The mute does not fit very well though as my bridge is quite thick, i can probably get it to sit on the top 5mm of the bridge, but it still does the job. 

2) My A2 if very boomy, it is as loud as an open string and the whole cello seems to ""emanate"" it more than any other stopped note, even with a mute on. I don't mind it really, I like the sound, I'm just wondering if there is a particular reason for it. 

3) Rosin seems to make a big difference. I like Pirastro Olive but I also have bought Cecilia which had such high ratings, but unless I apply A LOT more weight to the bow, my notes get all squeaky on Cecilia - I've tried it several times now on two acoustic cellos with the same result. Is it normal or is my crooked beginner hands?

449,,1613963160,lpdlhc,"I started playing cello 12 years ago when I was 10 years old. When I was 13 I got diagnosed with autoimmune arthritis which frequently caused my fingers, hands, and wrists to be swollen and painful. I continued playing after my diagnosis, but a few years ago, things got pretty bad, and my ability to practice was often severely limited by my arthritis. I really did love playing the cello, but eventually I just decided it wasn’t worth continuing to pay for lessons if I could barely practice at all in between. By the end of a 45 minute lesson, I often couldn’t even bend my fingers, and it took almost the full week to recover, and by then it was time for my next lesson. 

Within the last year, I’ve started a new medication for my arthritis, and it has worked incredibly. I haven’t had any pain or swelling at all in months. I’ve started to play my cello again, just in my free time. I feel like a beginner again. The issue I’m having now is that I just don’t feel as strong as I used to be. I find it takes so much strength to hold down the strings, and my left hand is exhausted after a short session. I find it especially difficult to change notes quickly because of how much force I exert to press the strings to the fingerboard. 

I know I will likely gain back some of my strength with practice, but is there anything I can do in the meantime that will make my cello less physically demanding to play? New strings for example? I have no idea what strings I have currently as it’s been so long since I’ve changed them. Could I get my bridge filed down to reduce the distance I need to press the strings to touch the fingerboard? Would a new bow help? I’m even willing to sacrifice a little sound quality as I’m not performing in front of anybody anytime soon. I just really want to get back to playing, without putting too much strain on my joints.

I’m open to any recommendations. I’m willing to spend a little, but I am a university student so I don’t currently have a fortune. For information, I live in Canada, and will likely have to order everything online because of where I’m located, but there is a luthier within driving distance.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

Here’s what I remember: it was fairly thick, had a mostly white cover with some orange (possibly a stripe from top to bottom near the binding?) and a realistic line drawing of a cello on the front. I also remember really small print. I vaguely remember the author starting with an s and sounding European. I’m not 100% on that, but I don’t think it was Suzuki. I don’t remember any other students having this book so likely not from one of the more popular series, but again not sure. I got it from a tutor who played in my city’s orchestra. 

Am I crazy/mixing up multiple books or does this thing exist? I thought about posting this into one of the finder-type subs but I figured I’d have better luck going to the folks who know the subject matter first!",Cello,Looking for a long-lost cello book
482,,1613366815,lk6me6,"Hello,

I know that this forum may lean heavily towards Cello, but I would like some honest opinions. 

**Right now, I am the crossroads of trying to choose a musical instrument. I have barely touched a musical instrument before, minus the usual stuff( recorder in Junior High, a few piano lessons as a child, rock guitar for a few months during high school.** 

**So, I am kind of picking my first instrument.  I am torn between the Cello and Double Bass.  Here is what draws me to each of them:**

**Pros of the Cello:**

**1. From an analogy from my other hobby Role Playing Video Games, you could say that the Cello is the Red Mage of stringed instruments. It can play Violin like melody parts, Harmony parts and Bass-like bass parts. This is analogous to Red Mages from some Role Playing video games who can use swords, cast white magic spells and black magic spells. Versatile within a genre.** 

**2. There are, as some inexpensive starter Cello's.  I am not sure if and where any cheap starter Double Basses exist**

**3. Cellos's are easier to transport than Double Basses.** 

**4. I am a fan of many musical movie theme soundtracks such as as Cider House Rules, Titanic, Shawshank Redemption, Downton Abbey, or Trading Places. All of these soundtracks are have some heavy string pieces. I definitely will be able to play such pieces with a Cello. I also enjoy some famous classical pieces such as Pachelbel's Cannon and the Overture to Marriage of Figaro. Additionally, I am a deep fan of a few rock songs where strings play a guest role. I wonder if anyone here has ever heard Ozzy Osbourne's ""So Tired.""** 

**5. There is emerging versatility across genre's with the Cello, including one Cello Based heavy metal band.** 

**Pros of the Double Bass:**

**1. I have heard that since there is larger room on the bow and you have to be less exact about hand placement, the Double Bass is easier for beginners to learn.**

**2. While the Cello has the most versatility within the genre of classical music and is starting to emerge across genre's, the Double Bass has more current versatility across genre's . It is established in Jazz bands and even a few rock groups.** 

**3. The Double Bass is a major staple in one of my many favorite kinds of music. Hawaiian music as in the Cazimero Brothers, Do Ho, Peter Moon Band. My late father was from Hawaii and the Double Bass known as an upright bass is a staple in most small scale Hawaiian musical acts. Playing the Double Bass would enable me to be participate in a Hawaiian style ensemble.** 

**4. From what I hear, Double Bass players are very much in demand.** 

**My questions are the following:**

**1. Would you have any suggestions between deciding between the Cello vs. Double Bass?**

**2. Are there any good suggestions you would have on where to obtain a good starter Double Bass kit?**

**3. How difficult is it to switch from the Cello to Double Bass and vice versa in case I want to change from one to the other or do both?**

**I would tremendously appreciate any thoughts or suggestions.** ",Cello,Adult Learner trying to decide between Bass and Cello

495,,1613223205,lj0mhi,"Long time lurker, first-time poster...

I'm a total beginner and have been playing with a rented cello for about three months. I've had problems with the pegs from the beginning. Every time I try and tune them (when the fine tuners are no longer enough), I have a super difficult time. As soon as I come close to one full note lower than what the string should be, the pegs slip and I have to start all over again. I'm doing the whole twisting-pushing thing as I tune and turning slowly. Twice as I've been doing this, I've snapped a string (while still far below the pitch, so it wasn't overtension). 

Today, it was the same thing again, except this time there was a loud bang and the bridge was suddenly on the floor. 

1. What should I do in the short-term? Loosen the strings and leave it? Try and put it back on?  The soundpost is still fitted. Do I just have to not practice until I can take it back to the luthier?
2. Does this seem normal to have such issues with the pegs? It's not the most expensive rental, and I'm wondering if it would be worth trying another cello/luthier? Is it just user error, even though I have no idea what I could be doing wrong. I do have a teacher, but we're only doing video lessons right now, so it's tricky to figure things out.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached.

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the Zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

507,,1613079710,lhvl05,"Hi cello Reddit!

I just got my cello back from a violin shop to replace a snapped bridge and re-set the sound post. After playing for only a minute or so I’m feeling that the action seems absurdly high... but I want to make sure I am in the right before complaining. 

A couple of things: 

Reading online I found someone suggest that the height from the end of fingerboard to strings should be 6mm at A and 8mm at G... I measured and currently it’s at 9 and 11 respectively. Did I measure from the right place? I measured from where the end of the fingerboard stops, so, the closest point to the bridge. 

And then... not that I am opposed in any way to supporting my local luthiers, but the cost for this was $370. When I looked around to find measurements it seems like this is quite high? Does anyone have an opinion on that? This is not a “fine” cello. It’s upper amateur at best, I think valued at $1400

Lastly, just another thing I want to check... and again, I am asking here *so that* i don’t come off as overly prissy when I chat about it with them... it is hard to tell that this bridge was carved. If it were, would it be pretty obvious?

I don't have any more degrees or certifications that I'd like to achieve professionally. I'd really like to learn more about music.

518,,1612958025,lgs2yj,"I am entering the wonderful world of vibrato and am finding it much easier to get a nice, fluid-sounding vibrato if I allow the final (distal) joint of the finger to ""collapse"" and straighten. This makes the fingertip meet the string at a more oblique angle, putting more of the pad onto the string and fingerboard. This makes the vibrato wider and also increases the amount of friction between finger and cello, meaning less downward force is needed to prevent the finger sliding. I also find it easier for the pumping motion of the arm to induce a rotation in the hand and finger like this - with a curved finger I get a narrower, shaking motion of the hand rather than rotation.

So, everything I've been taught and everything I've seen online lauds curved fingers in both basic playing and in vibrato. Most cellists vibrate with curved fingers and their hands rotate just fine. So: have I blundered into a dead end that I should abandon before it becomes a habit (which probably will just be a couple of weeks until my next lesson) or is this something that real cellists (who aren't Yo-Yo Ma...) do without issues?

Is there a way to achieve something similar without collapsing the final finger joint? I've tried lowering my elbow but it feels awkward. I think part of the issue is that I have very long nail beds, so when the fingers strike the fingerboard straight down, even with the nails filed right down, I think I have less surface area of fingertip touching the fingerboard than an average person - this might contribute to the lack of friction I described.

As far as I know it's expensive to upkeep of course due to the delicacy of the instruments.

522,,1612834500,lfrf8s,"Hey guys. Just a bit of background. I’ve been playing cello for 2 years and I’m self taught. I plan to start lessons sometime this year but I’ve mostly been watching tutorials and seeking feedback online.

So my left wrist hasn’t been feeling so good for the past 4 weeks. I just got an MRI done and it was concluded my TFCC (triangular fibrocartilage complex) has a COMPLETE tear on the ulnar side (that is, the side of my wrist close to the pinky). 

TFCC tears are usually due to trauma (like falling on an outstretched hand). However I don’t remember falling down. Another possible cause is excessive arm rotation. I know vibrato features forearm rotation. But would it be bad enough to cause a complete tear of my cartilage?

I also know too much tension could lead to injuries but my left hand is pretty relaxed. I’ve learnt pretty well to “hang” instead of squeezing the fingerboard. Also it doesn’t hurt my hand/wrist when I try my vibrato right now.

I wasn’t playing cello really when my wrist started acting up so I’m not sure if it is anyways. But I’m still curious, could doing vibrato cause something like this?

NB: I’ve  taken a break from cello btw to prevent further damage and heal.",Cello,TFCC tear in my wrist from vibrato?

The thing is that I curve my back away from the C-peg because otherwise it's poking me in the head, ear, or neck. So I lower my right shoulder and raise my left shoulder, and turn my head away from the peg. I've been playing around with the end pin and plaing my cello more horizontal or vertical, and more to the side... But it all doesn't feel right. When moving around while playing, the C-peg is still poking me, or the temples of my glasses, OR it's getting caught in my hair. When I move my cello a bit more to the side to not poke me, I don't feel I have control over it with my knees because my right knee is not really touching it. 

Do any of you have some more tips or video's which cover general posture? Or should I just accept C-peg pokes while playing? I know I shouldn't compensate but rather my cello, but I can't really figure it out. Oh yeah, and I'm 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall.",Cello,Posture problems

I used to play piano and a wind instrument for a few years, but the only other string instrument I've dabbled with is guitar and that never stuck, so I'm excited to start cello. So excited in fact that I want to begin learning now, before I even get my instrument.

It'll probably be a month or two before that happens because I'm still saving up and want to make sure I get a decent first cello (If anyone has any suggestions, that would be appreciated too!). So my question is, does anyone have any ideas on how I could start physically learning the fingering and notes and getting used to them? I had an idea of making a makeshift fingerboard and just ""practicing"" on that, but I'm not sure if that would work lol.

I'd also just like to preface.. I practically know nothing about cellos, never played any instrument in the bass clef, and I also have to re-learn how to read music again lol.

546,,1612040726,l8vp2u,"Violinist here looking to buy strings for a cello.. 

For violin dominant strings are seen by and large as the ""default"" string--they are a neutral string that is high quality, yet they can be found at a lower price than many of the high end strings. And despite new more expensive strings coming out every year, they are still favored by many world class professionals.

I thought I might be able to find the equivalent for cello, but it seems that it might be more complicated.

It's a professional quality cello, so I'm interested in buying quality strings for it, and I know they will be pricey (especially coming as a violinist). But the cello does not get played that often, only when the owner visits, a few days a month (but maybe more soon). So if the cello string market is anything like violin, I don't need anything over the top like the most expensive ultra-loud soloist strings. I am interested what exists as far as high quality relatively neutral string.. if that makes sense.

I know every instrument is different, but where do folks usually start? Thanks!

edit: I've identified the current strings as medium spirocore C and G, superflexible D and A. I'm inclined to get the same or similar, but these strings are very old, so if comparable strings are more common or well liked these days let me know.

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached.

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

It's nowhere near the level of proficiency for it to be passed off.

573,,1611497329,l403rl,"Hi everyone, I hope you are all good!

I know this was discussed on other topics already, but I tried everything that was advised and nothing seems to help, to I just wanted to start this one to see if there is anything else I could do.

Basically, similar as others, whenever I am playing the D and A strings, my shoulder gets really fatigued really fast - the feeling is similar as I was at the gym working out the muscle isolated.

It's not the entire shoulder, it's just the right shoulder lateral deltoid, and the weird thing is that I am not even shrugging my shoulder. It feels really relax, so I'm assuming I might be ""activating"" the wrong muscle while bowing.

I tried a lot of different things - cello angle, bow grips - but nothing seems to work. It's frustrating because I can't practice as much as I want, because I don't want to ""force"" the muscle (worried that it could get worse).

I was having issues with my thumb as well (sometimes both shoulder and thumb was hurting at the same time), but seems like I was able to fix the thumb issue partially by changing my bow grip.

I'm playing Cello for a little more than a month now, and currently I am playing a lot of open strings only just to try to find a good position that may help with this, but no luck so far...

Any other advice of what I could do here? :( - I really want to play the cello, but I'm honestly considering changing back to Violin because I can't get rid of this fatigue...

Any advice is much appreciated! :) - I will add a small video here of me playing, in case that helps.

Thanks in advance!

574,Student,1611463963,l3ssky,"Hey all I do a lot of sitting in a room teaching lately and I have bought a few quality of life things that might be helpful for you all. Here are the things that i found are not a waste:

[25 foot headphone extender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CNAV2YW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

This is certainly not an industry grade connector but it you are like me and use cheapo earbuds then this will let you walk around and stuff. Try not to run over it with your chair. 

[Symbio eartips](https://symbioeartips.com/)

These were an interesting find. They are essentially an earbud tip shaped foam earplug covered with a  silicone protector. They are pretty noise isolating and once you get the hand of putting them in pretty comfy. You have to pinch and roll them a bunch and then push them in for like 3-5 seconds. They also come from Hungary so if you are cheap like me and don't get the tracked mail expect 2-3 weeks for shipping. 

[Panasonic earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SKY2QQR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

These are super cheap but have a really nice sound, especially combined with the eartips above. Honestly I replace them when they break and I go through like a pair a year. But that was with commuting and stuff so I am hoping these will last longer. 

[10 foot long usb 3.0 extender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008219UMI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

for those pesky short wires connecting to your computer. I got 3 and I ended up using them all. 

[Amazon basics boom stands](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019NY2PKG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

These are pretty cheap quality and I would not trust an expensive microphone or my ipad on them. However for lights and other stuff and cheaper more durable microphones these are pretty neat. Good in a pinch. 

[forscore App for ipad](https://forscore.co/)

This is essential if you are trying to do music on your Ipad. Seriously check this app out its the bees knees. 

[reflector 3 ipad mirroring app](https://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector)

This little piece of software lets you set up your computer as an airplay device and then you can ""cast"" to it with your ipad. It pops up a little screen on your computer that mirrors your ipad screen. Great for screen shares and OBS window captures. 

[Pageflip firefly page turner](https://www.amazon.com/PageFlip-Firefly-Bluetooth-Turner-Pedal/dp/B00ILVHBKC/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=pageflip&amp;qid=1611463781&amp;sr=8-4)

575,,1611453242,l3pwqi,"Hey guys!

I've been playing cello for over 5 years now (and I'm just moving onto grade 6) but I still heavily rely on spots on the fingerboard to know where the notes are. I don't usually look at my left hand when playing unless I'm changing position which is happening more often now I'm getting to the higher grades.

Right now, I have spots for the first finger and fourth finger in first position and first finger in fouth position (for example on the A string that would be spots for B D and E). I used to have one for third finger first position but I got rid of it at the start of grade 5 because i found that i could use the fourth finger spot as reference for it whenever I was changing position.

I'm not very good at hearing notes (I can tell when a note is off but I find it hard to fix since i can never tell immediately if i'm sharp or flat) so I feel as if all hell will break loose if i get rid of the spots and am now left to guess where everything is.

I adore the Franck sonata, and it’s been in my list to tackle for a long time (I’ve played off and on with private study for ~14 years). When I listen to recordings of the last movement I’m hearing passages in different registers. 

Around the 4 minute mark [here ](https://music.apple.com/us/album/cello-sonata-in-a-major-fwv-8-iv-allegretto-poco-mosso/1483104300?i=1483104306): Capuçon takes the passage into a higher register, which I think is more accurate given the transcription from violin. Albeit, more difficult.

Does something like Colle for violins apply to cello too?

b) Today it detuned my A (again) and I finally broke it (yay, achievement unlocked) tuning it back up. :(

It was a surprise and no mistake. I over-tuned it, slowly, by less than a billionth of a nanohertz and it snapped. Could it have been the 20 minutes of cold while walking back from lesson?

The C also came loose by itself at some point, I noticed it just now when I gave it a sad strum walking past. Today sucks. :(((

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student .

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

593,,1611250504,l239hl,"I joined orchestra in highschool and my dad bought a cello for me. Fast forward 5-6 years of no longer playing cello, and I'm thinking about selling it. I can't find any information on my cello, and I don't even know what skill level it's meant to be for. It's a 2001 Wm. Lewis and Son Impressario. It was made for Marshall Music Co in Lansing Michigan. I live all the way down in New Mexico, and couldn't get ahold of them. The closest thing I was able to find on the internet was a violin made by Lewis in 2001 with the same Impressario name. It was priced for $550 used on a instrument sales website, and said that it was made in China.  

Looking at the cello, I can tell that it's carved, inlayed, and I'm pretty sure all the fittings are Ebony. It has a Teller bridge, and 4 fine tuning knobs. It has a padded soft case, a Wm. Lewis and Son bow, and a $50 carbon fiber bow (my dad wasn't sure that the cello would come with a bow). My dad bought the cello used on ebay, and my cello teacher was quite impressed with the quality of cello that my dad had managed to buy online. I don't know if the cello came with the bridge and strings, or if we got them from the lady that we paid to set up the cello. The varnish does have some chips and scratches, with the worst damage being to one of the pointy bits coming off the side of the cello (forgive my very non technical jargon, it's been years since I've looked into luthery (or however you spell it)). The nut at the top of the finger board has a small crack in it that doesn't seem to go through and doesn't seem to affect the playability of the cello.

I have no musical background, but had a great appreciation for music when I was young due to my grandparents influence. I am now creeping up on my 40s and for the last couple years have been trying to progress and learn. I have spent time trying to learn to read music, have been delving into some music theory, and obtained a cello that I have only tentatively attempted to practice on. I have even gone so far as to contact a local music school to which they recomended one of their students that gives lessons. 

My problem is that each time I go to practice, I become overwhelmingly anxious about playing due to such a lack of knowledge and experience. I understand full well that it can take a considerable time to be able to produce anything close to music with any real comfort but that logical part of me is being overridden by fear or embarrassment or anxiety.

Advice would be greatly appreciated.",Cello,An adult learner with anxiety

holding the baroque cello is not super complicated and is just a slight adjustment from your modern bow technique. Yes you put your finger on the hair, and yes you use your pinky and put it on top of the stick but apart from that, not that bad!  

This is the first of a series where I explain the parts of baroque cello technique and get into the basics and the more complex parts of playing the baroque cello. This video is a bit of a basic primer on holding the baroque bow, but I will get into all the specific fiddly bits later, just you wait!   

Also a side note, if you have watched any previous videos of mine you will hear some wonderful macBook fan accompaniment but I put it in the closet behind me and no more noise! wow!!!!

Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student .

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

If you are feeling a bit unhappy with your recorded sound and you feel like your setup and equipment is all fine, try adding a touch of reverb! 

The trick is to find that sweet spot where the reverb makes your cello sound a bit fuller/rounder but doesn't make it sound unrealistically big or washed out. 

You can do this live or in post. I am sending my cello mic (AT pro35) to an effects petal (Zoom a1 four) where I have a few reverbs loaded up I have been playing with. However you could totally take your track and run it through your favorite DAW and add reverb there. 

If you are doing reverb post I would recommend sending tracks to a 100% wet reverb track and adjusting the reverb volume from there. This lets you blend the reverb in and makes it sound a bit more ""natural"".

l've been a private lessons teacher for a while before 2020 but took a break after the pandemic happened.  l recently scored a side gig as a teacher for Music and Arts which are going to be exclusively on Zoom.   I've always been able to guide students thru lessons by placing their fingers, arm height, etc to the optimal places, walk around to get better angles, etc.   Obviously l won't be able to do this any longer and will need to rely on verbal specificity, etc.   I will be teaching predominantly young beginners/intermediates.  Does anyone who has been doing online teaching have some quick tips or common challenges l might not be aware of?  I'd appreciate any help as l really want to do well on my return to teaching and have never taught online.",Cello,Help teaching Zoom lessons - any tips?

675,,1610212011,ktuoxr,"I just read about it and need to share because it is so fascinating and heart-warming.

Benjamin Zander is a conducter who was teaching in a university for talented musicians and he observed, that the students had a problem: They were scared, scared to perform, scared to fail. And he asked himself what could he do to help. And this is what he did:

He said to his students all of them will get an A when they write him a letter ""Dear Mr. Zanders, I got my ""A"" because..."" addressed to themselves one year in the future but written in past tense . In this letter they should tell him as detailed as possible why they will have deserved the A not only from a musician point of view but especially from their own personal development. And the letters and reactions to it are all so touching. Just a little example:

*""Dear Mr Zander,*

*I got my A because I had the courage to examine my fears and I realized that they have no place in my life. (...) Thus all diffidence and lack of belief in myself are gone. So too is the belief that I only exist as a reflection in other people's eyes and the resulting desire to please everyone.... I understand that trying and achieving are the same thing when you are your own master - and I am. I have found a desire to convey music to other people, which is stronger than the worries about myself. I have changed from desiring inconsequentiality and anonymity to accepting the joy that comes from knowing that my music changes the world""*

It can listen on the mic along with sheet music, and analyze your playing to tell you what notes were early/late, wrong note, or missed. It looks promising, but the app is a little on the glitchy side and has a very limited catalog. It reminds me a lot of Roland's old V-Drums Tutor software, which was even better since the early/late/wrong indication was realtime as you played (and that one consumed midi files and connected to e-drums via midi, so it was a bottomless catalog and very accurate recognition).

Anyone know of other similar apps like this for string instruments (specifically cello)? I know there are a few GuitarPro-like programs that will scroll along a midi, but specifically I'm interested in the recognition and feedback aspect for tightening up timing and pitch with apps.

686,,1610089136,ksxav2,"Right before making a big jump up the fingerboard, change the angle of your hand so that your fingers are pointing towards the direction you’re shifting. 

The mechanism behind this is simple. Normally, our fingers are about perpendicular to the fingerboard (your finger forms a 90 degree angle with the length of the fingerboard). If you tried to shift from this position, you’ll feel a lot of friction because a large, fleshy portion of your finger is rubbing against the fingerboard. This makes shifting harder than it needs to be.

By shifting the fingers closer to parallel with the fingerboard, your hand is in a much more natural position to fall down on its own. It also reduces friction because less of your fingertip is in contact with the fingerboard. 

This is a simple fix but it makes a big difference. Happy practicing!",Cello,Simple trick to improve your shifts

688,,1610056839,ksny3j,"Our next meetup will be **this Saturday, again at 8 PM Scottish time (GMT).** For those that haven't joined before: **Our meetups are supposed to be fun and super-casual.** Those that want to play and share some of the music they are currently working on, are welcome to do so. Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student . If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that **these meetings take place every week**, always on Saturday and always at 8 PM Scottish time. I will make a new post each week though and add in the zoom details shortly before the meeting.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece. 
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM** Scottish time. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

I learnt cello with a teacher for six years (not anymore, that's why I'm asking here) and holding the bow has always been a problem for me. But right now it's to a point that I don't even want to play anymore.

I tried everything but nothing feels right. Just the simple fact of bending the thumb is not confortable because the ""edge"" of the bow where I put my thumb is too sharp, it's not painful but very unconfortable. I can't have a good grasp, it's like the bow slips between my fingers.

Once I went to college, I didn't play much anymore, and not long after I pretty much stopped entirely. I'm 22 now and really want to get back to it: I can feel my cello staring at me reproachfully from the corner and it makes me feel guilty XD. Needless to say after 5 years without practice, I've lost a lot of my skills. I try to go back to my old performance pieces, even the ones from when I was 15-16 like Mendelssohn's 'song without words' or Faure's 'Elegie' but  even going all the way back to the Bhrams concerto it just sounds horrible. I tend to be very emotional and usually within 15-20 minutes I wind up in tears. The notes are (usually) in the right place but the piece has lost all its emotion. Even on my best days it sounds like a computer-generated piece, and on my bad days it sounds like a middle school recital. And then, inevitably, I get too ashamed of the terrible sound and put the cello back down and don't touch it for another couple weeks.

Of course I'm never going to get any better by not practicing, but how do returning players stop themselves from feeling too discouraged?

I can’t see why people should do that unless there is a monetary compensation, but maybe I am being too nihilistic and some other things come into play like the sheer joy of mentoring someone, friendship, similar way of thinking, etc.

709,,1609803088,kqkzl7,"Hi all,

I bought a cello recently, and as I learn to play it I suddenly remembered a song I used to listen to a while ago featuring a cello that uses an effect that I'm completely unfamiliar with.

Here's the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VigOLpFWjlI

At first I thought maybe it was maybe some effect thrown on in post but now I'm not so sure? It sounds like he's vibrating the bow really fast, maybe sort of like double picking on a guitar very quickly.

Is this indeed some technique that has since evaded my google searchings?

718,,1609571048,kosysp,"Hello guys, 

I thought I would ask the questions here, I believe you guys know the answers. 

In no particular order: 

1. Are 2cellos very well known in the Cello community?
2. Do they cheat, or are all the Cello sounds they produce genuinely from Cellos? Sure I understand they have amplification and use some percussion instruments, and I believe some of their songs also feature an electric guitar. 
3. 2set used to have me thinking that the violin was at the top end of the spectrum of musical instruments. And it is, but after listening to 2Cellos I'm starting to wonder why. Seems to me the Cello is a more than capable solo instrument, and has the range to perform such a wide variety of roles. Seems to me as a classical guitarist that the Cello is a much deeper broader and more universal instrument, is this correct? Why then does the violin still keep getting all the solo parts? 
4. I have to also say that Segovia was wrong. I have great respect for the man, the so called grandfather of my instrument, but to me personally I see the Cello as the most expressive instrument, or maybe I'm just wrong but 2cellos certainly showcase this. 

Thoughts?",Cello,A few questions about 2cellos?

722,,1609516196,koddkj,"Our next meetup will be **this Saturday, again at 8 PM Scottish time (GMT).** For those that haven't joined before: **Our meetups are supposed to be fun and super-casual.** Those that want to play and share some of the music they are currently working on, are welcome to do so. Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student. If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :) 

Note that I will also be happy to continue hosting these meetings on a weekly basis as long as there is interest in them. I will always make a new post each week and add in the zoom details the day of the meeting. Time and day of the week will always be the same though.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece.
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM BST**. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

First I wanna say that I'm not really a complete beginner, as I already have years of experiment with other instruments, and intend to self learn to play cello as a hobby. There are somethings that I'm not sure about this instrument yet and would love to hear from mature players :)

\- How good should my intonation be? How accurate (how many cents deviated from true notes) can decent cellists play, in lower as well as higher positions? As mentioned I have much experience in music and hence good sense of pitch. In 1st and 2nd position, if given time, I can generally grope for notes that are about 10 cents apart from correct notes, but can never touch the right spot right away. I would like to know an average skill so that I can set a goal for practicing.

\- I usually position my bow right in the middle between the bridge and the bottom of the fingerboard. However I noticed that when playing in ≥ 5th positions, the D and G string would be pressed down an angle so large, that the spots where my bow touches them would lie almost flat or even below the neighboring strings, making the bow impossible to reach.

So, I'm relatively newish to Cello, but not to playing music in general, and I play a handful of other instruments.

I've tried all the usual fixes - More rosin, less rosin, cleaning strings, harder/softer bow pressure, tilting the bow, more flat bow, etcetc... I'll sit and just bow back and forth and right when I think I've got it it goes to garbage again. I don't have this issue on any other string.

I learned on a traditional acoustic cello and played for close to ten years so I do have a pretty solid foundation already. I chose the electric because I live in an apartment and need to be able to practice quietly.

My question is in regards to amps. I will not be playing with the goal to perform, at least not for a long while.

761,,1608782858,kj8eia,"Hey there, cello folks. 

I picked up the violin close to a year ago and have kept with it daily and made good progress. I told myself I’d wait at least a year before picking up another instrument to learn. 

The time will be here in a couple months. 

I have really been wanting to play cello since it can go so much lower than the violin. 

So, my questions...

1. Is 1k enough for an “ok” instrument that will last a few years? I know with violins there is a lot of variation in quality. Are cellos similar?

2. Will the rosin for my violin work for the cello bow? 

3. I have a decent violin bow I invested in for the long term. I know nothing of fellow bows. Is there as large a gap in quality between bow types as there is with violin? 

4. Not really a major question but...are the bowing techniques the same or similar? I know the weight of the bow isn’t really on the string the same way it is with violin but does that make as big a difference as I think?

5. I have a violin teacher. I am not rich. I will consider a cello teacher if I invest in a cello. I would never try to teach myself violin, it’s just not a good thing to do. Is cello more or less self teaching friendly?

6. I’ll visit my luthier, I don’t know what to look for in cellos. What are some things I should look at and be aware of when trying them out? I plan on asking if renting is an option also.",Cello,Beginner questions

First of all, merry christmas to you all :)) I hope 2021 is a better year for all of us.

I completed my atcl at the end of 2017, and then stopped playing for a while as life got in the way. I played sporadically, on and off in orchestras and ensembles for about 2 years whilst I was still at school, but nothing amazing. In the last month or so, however, I’ve fallen back in love with the cello and am seriously considering working towards my ltcl. 

In starting this process, I need to select some repertoire to start learning. If anyone else has done an A or L TCL (or equivalent in your country!), I would love to know what you played!

This was my programme (cant remember the order) for my ATCL:
Kol Nidrei (Max Bruch)
Shostakovich cello sonata op. 40 3rd movt
Polonaise Brillante (Chopin)
Elgar cello concerto in E minor (1st movt, i love this piece)

I’m currently thinking about the Popper Polonaise, as i started learning this briefly and so can already play it. Id be very interested to know how this fit into anybody else’s programme. Other than that, I dont have many other ideas!!

I'm trying to see if any of you might remember or saved a video posted a few years ago where a young cellist was explaining a technique to play artificial harmonics in thumb position whilst keeping the 'normal' fingerings. 

I vaguely remember it had something to do with leaving behind some fingers and you could get the full scale as harmonics without jumping octaves whilst fingering as you would normally. It was one of my first saved posts before finding out that reddit just deletes the old ones as you accumulate more.

As in, C5 gives me a feeling of C6 on a violin. 

Similarly, I really enjoy playing on C and G strings first position but on recordings of other cellists they sound much lower and more bass to me then when I actually play them myself. Is it a similar effect to our own voice sounding very different to us when we hear ourselves speaking compared to when we hear ourselves in recording? The fact of playing the instrument, feeling it’s vibration, changes the sound perception?

775,,1608537729,khcy7i,"So here is my situation:
I am practicing cello for 2 years now. I am learning from a teacher at my local music school. As I started he recommended a small local business who sells, repairs, builds and rents Cellos. I am renting a Cello (including softcase and bow) from this place for 240€/6 months. The contract says the value of the Cello is 3600€. It also says 4/4 and “romanian”. I don’t know anything else about this Cello. I guess he built it by himself out of wood from Romania?

After dipping my toe into the joy of playing cello for two years I can say that I like it and I want to continue playing as a hobby (nothing crazy, just for myself or in an amateur orchestra when I am good enough).
Now I did the math and it seems like financially it would be a good idea to stop paying monthly rent and buy a cello.

I only played on the cello I am renting right now and I am not skilled or confident enough to go to a store and test some cellos.
Since I am still a beginner I wouldn’t know what to look for in a cello. I like the one I am renting but have no comparison at all.

There was never a problem with the cello I am renting for now but I guess a cello needs a check up as any other instrument which is regularly played. Cost for repair is included in the rent right now. What are the things which need regular care / repair (I guess strings an bow hair) and how much does it normally cost?
Do people rent a cello for long term or is renting recommended for beginners who are not sure about if they like the cello (I am past that point)? When is a good time to have an opinion on “is this a good cello for me”? Do I have to think about different bows as well?

I guess the overall question is: should I buy a cello?

I tightened the bridge tuner as much as I could and it was still barely an A flat.    Then I tried very slowly tightening the peg and it immediately snapped the string again.

What did I do wrong?   Is it possible the bridge is out of place causing more tension on the string than needed?  I remember the bridge fell out a while back and I tried placing it back myself, and since then the A string immediately breaks every time I try to tighten the peg even a smidge.   And yes it keeps slipping every time which is very annoying.  Even at the shop they were having problems with this.

Should I just go get a complete tune-up and have them fix the bridge and restring everything? Can something be done to stop the peg from slipping?

Music instrument performing can be complex since it requires complicated and asymmetrical motions of both hands, which need good muscle coordination to complete. To grasp all these motions, music instrument learners are supposed to practice for a lot of times in a long term.

For young music learners, they may need more supervision in daily practice. When they are taking music lessons, teachers can play the role of supervisors. But when lessons end, teachers are not likely to follow up students’ practice 24/7. Therefore, parents are ideal ones to take up the baton and help their children’s practice after music lessons.

https://preview.redd.it/azgq3kq51i561.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0205b32e7b9f0c3d6a6f337374c7ca7d278d713c

**So what should parents do to be helpful after music instrument lessons?**

First of all, music parents need to keep in mind that their company is aimed at **helping children improve practicing efficiency and enjoy the process**, rather than watching whether their children have practiced.

# Treat Practicing after Music Lessons Like Relaxation

There are academic classes for children, there should be after-school activities as well. Taking various classes, such as Math, PE, Science, etc, is the daily routine. Then after school, they are likely to be faced with piles of endless homework.

With so many different subjects, it is no wonder that setting a time slot to practice music instrument can seem like a burden to a kid. Therefore, music parents need to help their children see playing music in a different light.

Rather than treating practicing like any other subject, parents need to create a distinction so that children see violin practice as relaxation. The best way to shift children’s mindset is to let them play music which they are actually interested in.

# Let Children Play Music They Like

While there are always certain signature songs and classics for violin, or for piano, or for any music instrument, children may lose interest if he or she does not like the music/music instrument they are playing. Parents can try to work with their children’s teacher to make sure that their children have the chance to learn and play some music they truly enjoy.

According to the Academy of Music and Dance, “As children get to be around 10 years old, sometimes younger, they start to develop preferences for musical style, which is largely influenced by internet, radio, TV, and whatever they are most exposed to at home. They will also typically gravitate to whatever their friends are listening to.”

Parents can use this as a motivational strategy and allow their children to play at least one song they like as part of their weekly routine. Classic repertories are also essential, but performing other songs the children enjoy can work as an impetus for daily practicing.

# Make Music Practice after Lessons Fun

This should come as no surprise. No one wants to practice when it is boring. Incorporate fun games, activities, and challenges can make young music instrument learners look forward to practicing.

In fact, very few children are self-motivated in their daily practice. Most need incentives and reminders to keep them focused and moving forward. Parents may also communicate with the music teachers and develop some creative ways making practice more fun.

# Form A Practice Schedule and Create Challenges

To form a schedule or a to-do list can help people avoid procrastination in some way. Parents may let their children determine the practice schedule. In this way, children are more likely to stick to it.

Children hear parents tell them what to do all the time. To catch their attention, letting them plan their own practice schedule can be effective. Besides, it really improves their strategic thinking in a long term.

Basically, parents can get their children to determine when to practice, what to practice, and how long to practice. After the decision is made, parents can help children research and figure out how often a good musician practices. The children then can set a schedule based on the reality that one must practice more to become excellent. Not only will this allow children to feel a sense of control, it will also help them learn the value of practice.

Besides, parents can help children set specific goals and challenges. This will help them progress faster because they will work on accomplishing specific tasks or mastering particular skills. Don’t just ask kids to ‘practice’. Instead, parents may give them bite-sized and clear challenges to complete. For example, set a goal like working out a fingering for measures 24–35, or gradually speeding up section B to 85 bpm.

# Be Children’s Cheerleader and Celebrate All Accomplishments They Made under the Music Teachers’ Guidance

Parents should let children know that they always had their parents as the biggest fans, especially when they may feel frustrated or discouraged.

Parents are supposed to listen to their children at home as often as possible and make encouraging remarks about children’s progress. Also, parents should make sure to ask their young learners how the music lessons went. Once parents take a genuine interest in their children’s musical journey, the young musicians will be excited to play.

Moreover, parents need to celebrate their children’s little victories along the way of violin learning. Learning to play the violin is a long journey full of peaks, valleys, and plateaus. Celebrating the little victories will help children keep a positive attitude when they are struggling or having difficulty tackling a new concept or song.

While verbal praise and giving some rewards are important, parents may also find another way to celebrate achievements. Keeping a journal of children’s accomplishments can be a good way. When parents put it in writing, they are less likely to forget.

# Plan Performances for Children

When it comes to music instrument learning, we all know that it is important to keep the little performers engaged and excited about their music education. Giving them the chance to perform consistently throughout the year can definitely hit the mark. Consistent performances continue to motivate children. Scheduled performances on campus, instrument performing competitions and other occasions all work well.

By planning performances for children and encouraging them to be on stage, parents can help children increase excitement and confidence. Besides, it may make children themselves recognize that more practice means avoiding embarrassment at a recital.

https://preview.redd.it/bohtzy2o3i561.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9db91554cc17bc93d74b7a8b5bc3c40c55d9c83c

# Help Children Engage with Music and Understand the Gift of Music

Children are more likely to practice music if they feel connected to the process. Parents need to help their young learners develop an interest and curiosity for music. Once children find themselves are engaged with music, they are more likely to be willing to practice.

Besides, parents should be engaged with music themselves. They can create a musical atmosphere at home by showing interest to music, for example, listening to music and sing together. In this way, children may naturally want to imitate their parents, so it is a big motivation for children to practice.

What’s more, parents should take efforts to confirm children that playing the music instrument is an opportunity that is not necessarily available to everyone. They need to teach children to appreciate music and what music can offer and help them discover that music can enhance their life. To make children understand the gift of music, parents can take them to concerts or shows, play music at home, and help them discover what they like. This can also help children understand why practicing after music lessons is important.

Different parents may have various ways to help their children’s daily practice. All the ways are aimed at providing children with effective practice and also a chance to make achievements. The whole process requires all parents’ participation and efforts.

805,,1608029386,kdjlnn,"Hi all, my brother's cello needed to be restrung, and so I changed mine as well since they were well over 10 years old. My old set was still in pretty good condition, but I figured that it was a good opportunity to get a few sets of strings and do some testing. My brother's cello settled into its new strings decently well, but my cello seems to not like the new setup, and I'm wondering if it's common for cellos to ""reject"" strings.

For some context, I recently changed my cello strings from a Larsen Magnacore Mediums (ADGC) to a combination of Jargar Superior (AD) and Thomastik Spiral-Tungsten Mediums (GC). My old set on my cello felt both rich and mellow, and was pretty balanced in tone, tension, and projection. However, my new set is markedly different. The Jargar Superiors are punchier and project more than the last set, but the Thomastiks feel at least three times louder than my old GCs and maybe around two times louder than the Jargars.

And therein lies the problem. The Thomastiks are **so** resonant that my cello actually shakes and buzzes when I play on the G string, and I can't figure out where it's coming from. From a purely tonal perspective, I don't dislike the changes. The new tones are pretty interesting and fun to play with if I'm gentle, but I also recognize that the sound balance for my cello is totally off and I'm thinking of switching back to the old set.

I had my cello checked by a luthier earlier this year, and he said that it was in good condition. I'm also not dying to play on these strings, even if I like their sound, so it might be overkill going back to have the luthier adjust my cello just for the new strings (especially since I quite liked my old set). Does anyone have any thoughts on this? My cello isn't cheap, it was bought from Hammond Ashley in the 5k range, but now I'm wondering if there might have been something intrinsically wrong with it that the old strings were masking.",Cello,Variation on (Resonant) Strings

Then college sucked the life out of me but I'm finally picking up the cello again after several years. I'm using a newer cello that is not what I'm used to playing. I am pretty sure it's entry-level in price.

I'm attmepting to mimic a professional recording of some favorite numbers, and it's hard for me to audibly tell when they go to different strings. Yet when I play, the difference between strings is obvious, and detracts from the purity of the cello's song.

The Junior Programmes offer what seems like a really good opportunity to play in groups, to sing in a choir, to receive training on musicality and to make friends with peers who share their passion for music, but it means giving up their existing instrumental music teachers. 

My instinct for the moment is probably to keep him with his current teachers as he really likes them and they seem to be getting great results, and perhaps look at things again when the auditions come around again in Spring 2022 (for admission in September 2022). The counter-argument is that because of the rate of his progress, perhaps waiting until Sep 22 is too long.

819,,1607836693,kc4w7k,"I've been struggling with this internal debate for the better part of a year, whether to keep my cello around. Through various differing opinions from mentors and friends, I've decided to reach out to seek other opinions. I apologize in advance if any of my explanation sounds arrogant or aloof, I just would like to illustrate some of the external factors in my reasoning.

To keep a long story short, I (19M, graduated 2019) have been playing since the 5th grade (9). To give a sense of the local politics, there were two districts with string programs, with one being much more highly regarded than the other (All-State orchestra line-ups rarely included the one district but the other was shoe-ins). 

In high school, I was respected as one of the better youth cellists in the community, being placed best in class at one district (seniority/skill based seating, in that order) and 3rd chair in the other (raw skill). I played in several trios and quartets, each with their own relative respect, including pairings of students from both districts. I was one of the few that jumped the divide between the two districts through extracurricular music activities, and made many good friends. 

The summer after my sophomore year, I had been personally invited to fill in for a music festival/summer intensive. While it was an outstanding experience, and one I'd like to do again, I solidified my decision not to pursue music beyond a recreational love. I could not devote my life in that manner, the stress seemed just to much to bear. I still loved the camaraderie and connection I had playing recreationally.

My junior year was nothing spectacular, until our district was selected to play at the state music educators conference, where I would be a featured member of a concertina in performance of a concerto grosso.

Eventually, after some flukes, I ended up transferring to the other district for my senior year, therefore forfeiting my seat in the aforementioned conference.

That year, for many reasons, was probably the lowest point of my short time on this rock, but I still had music. I had music through family deaths, alienation of friends, breakups, school transfers, debilitating migraines that resembled strokes, everything. Through everything, my cello stood by my side.

This school has a competition for senior performances, to cut down on program times. The night before, as I'm working on some passages of Kabalevsky 1, I need to take out some trash. I slip and break my wrist. As rehearsals continue as my fracture heals, I realize that I had a near certain chance of being selected. Because of that, and the other previous history, I mentally threw in the towel. I finished the year, graduated, and have since touched my cello 3 times. Each time, I can't help but have this bitter mindset regarding playing. Hence, the thought has crossed my mind, ""should I sell my cello?""

I can't bring myself to any definitive answer, as they have pros and cons. On one hand, this object that once was the joy and pride of my life has now turned into this dark cloud. But on the other, I give myself the opportunity to reframe the experiences on my own terms, without having to later find a cello.

832,,1607633158,kansuh,"Our next meetup will be **this Saturday, again at 8 PM Scottish time (GMT).** For those that haven't joined before: **Our meetups are supposed to be fun and super-casual.** Those that want to play and share some of the music they are currently working on, are welcome to do so. Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student. If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :)

Note that I will also be happy to continue hosting these meetings on a weekly basis as long as there is interest in them. I will always make a new post each week and add in the zoom details the day of the meeting. Time and day of the week will always be the same though.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where mistakes are allowed.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece.
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM BST**. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

833,,1607630521,kamv2o,"Some additional details--neither comes with a bow. The NS comes with a stand but not the endpin setup (that makes it feel more like a real cello), and that would add an extra $300 (I would likely get it though) so now its 1200. The yamaha is the old version of the 210, its from the early 2000s and has some cosmetic damage. The previous owner also did some kind of janky stuff with the bridge to make it work. The NS doesn't have any cosmetic damage.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone tried both and have opinions? I've gone through some old threads on here and read that the NS requires more signal processing than a yamaha, and I've also read that the NS has a more natural sound than the yamaha.

My son has been playing cello about a year and he absolutely loves it. He begs me to wake him up when I get up at 6:15am so that he has plenty of time to practice before he needs to get ready for school. He seems to have a real facility for music (learned to read music in about a week, finds music theory really interesting, loves nothing more than learning about new technique, and he is developing a good sense of what he likes musically - basically Bach, Bach and more Bach!). He is progressing really well and really enjoying it. 

He is currently playing a standard beginner cello borrowed from school. It is fine (at least since I replaced the strings), but I am vaguely thinking about buying him his own cello as he clearly isn't going to give it up any time soon, and given the rate of his progress I am not going to be hanging on for him to grow into a 7/8 or 4/4 size cello (he is 8 and really quite small compared to peers, so I am guessing we have at least 4 years at 3/4 size). If I am going to be buying a 3/4 size then I may as well get it sooner rather than later, but most instruments of that size are pitched at being very much first cellos.

My principal study is violin and I’m looking to go on to do a post graduate degree in performance at a conservatoire when I graduate. Music is my passion but as great as violin is, I’ve always been in love with the cello. I’m insanely jealous of the cellists in my orchestra and solo cello repertoire is one of my favourite things to listen to. I find pre 1900 solo violin repertoire is centred around silly virtuosity and I find it uninspiring. I really enjoy a lot of post 1900 solo violin repertory but nowhere near as much as I enjoy pretty much anything written for the cello. When I first started learning music at 7, I wasn’t offered the cello and so I picked the violin because it was my favourite of what was offered to me. When I joined a small orchestra soon after I realised that I much preferred the cello and I asked to switch but my mother wouldn’t let me. I begged for years and eventually gave up asking. Anyway, the further and further into the professional world of music I get the more I realise that violin will always be a second best to me and I really should have played the cello. Is it too late for me to switch? I know my old violin teacher did this with violin to viola around my age but that’s a much smaller switch than violin to cello.

Music has always had a huge impact in my life from a young age. To the point where, as a member of the furry community, my fursona is a cat with speakers for cheeks and antennae. It’s always bugged me that I can’t play anything. The cello has always been my favorite instrument despite my love of rock and metal music. 

When I went into the shop to ask about renting a cello and taking classes the guy working went to get a couple to find the correct size since I’m on the smaller side. 

When we found the right size he gave me a bow and showed me how to use it. He was a violinist and instructed me how hold be bow correctly and play. When another customer came in he told me to try it out and left to help them. To say I was happy was an understatement.

857,,1607322113,k8b9az,"Here's part of a blog post I wrote on this subject:

**The question of size:** 

Should an adult choose a smaller cello?

I have a 1/10 size cello at home for a young grandchild. It’s still a bit large for her. Can you imagine if I gave her a full size (4/4) cello to play? That would be ridiculous! She couldn’t hold it between her knees, she couldn’t reach down to use the bow correctly, and she certainly couldn’t play it in tune because her hands are tiny. Sitting at the piano, her hand span is about four white keys. Most adults’ piano handspan would be between 9 and 11 white keys.

Stringed instruments are made in different sizes because not all people are the same. We know that children are given smaller cellos, violins, violas or basses. Why not do the same for adults? 

* What are the secret herbs and spices used in choosing the correct size for an adult? 
* Shouldn’t adults just play a grown-up (full-size) cello?
* If I play a smaller cello am I diminished as a musician somehow, like being given a child’s toy?
* Will a smaller cello sound worse or less than a “normal” one? 
* How small is too small? 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The year I turned 13, on my teacher’s advice I was given my first full-size cello. I was so proud of it. It supported my musical growth very nicely for the next 5 years until my last teacher advised us to upgrade prior to leaving school, studying cello at college and pursuing my musical career. As a young professional I found certain aspects of my technique very difficult and although it didn’t stop me working and teaching, I was always a little frustrated with how hard I found some specific passages of music when others seemed to breeze through them. 

Around three decades later I left my teaching job to work in a music store and guess what I discovered? There is a wonderful array of smaller options I’d never encountered. Another decade passed and I took the plunge down to a seven-eighth size cello. My hand is so much happier and I can actually master some of those pesky passages that previously eluded me … 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*As a teacher it didn’t even cross my mind to suggest smaller players might need a smaller cello. In line with the general approach of most teachers, when they reached high school we moved them to full size. 

One of our regular patrons is a lovely lady with the most gorgeous half-size cello that is exactly the right size for her. When our workshop has given it a new bridge or done other work it is a real joy to test this beautiful small cello before calling to say it’s ready. 

How do I decide the correct size for someone? 

There are four main factors I need to consider: 

* **Body height**. Does the cello fit in terms of body height? At 172cm I can easily cope with a 4/4 cello, but my fingers are a bit short. Somebody who is 155cm will always struggle with full size.
* **Body shape**. Remember that we have to grip the cello lightly with our knees/calves and lean it comfortably against the chest, with the scroll just behind our right ear. Sometimes we might choose a different size OR different body design: Strad is slimmer, Montagnana is wider. I’ve chosen a 7/8 Montagnana because I needed a slightly shorter fingerboard to accommodate my shorter fingers, but the fatter cello felt more comfortable. It also sounds wonderful!
* **Arm length**. Maybe your body can cope with a certain size, but if your arms are shorter perhaps the next size down would help. Remember, at some stage you will be playing the full length of the fingerboard, and need to be able to maintain correct handshape and elbow position. 
* **Hand size/finger length**. To me, this is the most important factor by far. If your fingers can’t fairly naturally fall into reasonably good semitones in first position, then you will struggle in much of your playing. You need to be able to play in extended position, and to keep good handshape in thumb position. The wrong size cello will hurt your hands and may well give you RSI or similar.

When my (now nearly 29) teenage daughter moved schools in Year 10 and needed her own cello, I bought a 4/4 one which sounded lovely but was always too large. She would occasionally complain about pain and ask me to tell her teacher to ease off on making her stretch for notes that she couldn’t reach. I still didn’t understand. Many years later this same daughter came to our shop for a 7/8 and we found even that was much too large, so she purchased a very nice 3/4 size cello which suited her just right. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**The question of pain** is an interesting one: 

I’ve spent much of the last decade consulting frequently with an excellent musculoskeletal doctor because of various issues associated with being an cellist and enthusiastic young man who didn’t always lift things within his limits (or do it correctly!) despite warnings from those who were older and wiser. Now that I'm getting older I have developed a keen interest in understanding how my body works when I play the cello.

There have been times when adult learners have visited our shop, or we’ve met at one of our trade displays, and conversation has found its way to the pain in their hands, shoulders or back. When I have then tried them on our cellos we have found two big factors which seem to contribute to the problem: posture, especially relating to shoulder and elbow positioning; and cello size, which first affects our ability to form the ideal hand shape and position when playing, and second, affects our posture and compounds the whole thing! Finding the most appropriate size can be a lifesaver indeed.

In a couple of cases these lovely, eager cellists have developed something similar to “trigger finger” or “trigger thumb”. Their cellos were full-size and they had ended up in so much pain they had stopped playing for long periods of time. We have looked at posture, changed to smaller cellos, given some appropriate hand exercises, and in one case sent our friend to see a good hand O.T.; and now they are happily playing again with much better results. One of these two ladies moved to 7/8  and the other now has a 3/4  cello. Finding the right size, and working with posture/technique, made all the difference. And once upon a time I, like most other cello teachers, would have continued to inflict 4/4 pain on them until they eventually gave up because just looking at a cello would induce a nasty sensation … 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The question of sound: 

Choosing a smaller instrument will reduce the sound a little, but it doesn’t have to be a problem. Plenty of young children reach a very high standard while still playing on 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 cellos, completing all the exam grades and even progressing to the diploma levels. For this reason, there are also plenty of smaller cellos made to meet the quality requirements associated. 

7/8 and 3/4 size cellos:

Most adults with smaller hands will require a 7/8 cello. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Here's a link to my original article. I know most people reading this are not in Australia so the various models I recommend won't apply to you, however there is a great brand of cellos made in USA called Jay Haide, and their 7/8 are awesome. Presumably there would be a range from Scott Cao as well. I play a Jay Haide Montagnana 7/8.

863,,1607251479,k7rn1i,"Hi Reddit! 👋

Have been practicing since I got my cello in September and wanted to share a recording I made today of me playing The Elephant. I know I sound like trash but I played it from memory, 😁 which is something I never did as a child. My string transitions are not that awful here as some of the times I play either.

https://sndup.net/7fjq

I love my cello, it's great. I got a Stentor student II model coz it has the ebony fingerboard and got some Pro Arte strings for cheap. They are old stock and I'm worried they may break easily so I'm careful about tuning. Sound 10 times better than the strings it came with. In the new year I plan to take it to a luthier to have someone set it up professionally but for now it can make pretty enough sounds (not so much by me). The girl at the music shop thinks that the Stentor cellos come set up and ready to play from their factory in China, so putting that theory to test I'm trying to break it in a bit as is. After Christmas when I have more money I will get it set up properly though and have a new bridge installed. 

Had one lesson in last week of September a few days after putting a fingertape decal thing (it's off now) on my cello. Was fun and I learnt stuff but they were not interested in providing ongoing lessons to me. Obviously I was a bit disappointed and felt bad but the way they played vibrato made it sound like the cello was dying (I didn't share that) so upon reflection maybe it's not so bad. Total waste of sixty bucks and I wish I'd spent the money on sheet music 😜

In primary school my teacher used the all for strings books and I remember going through all three but no longer have the ability to play all the music now. I stopped playing in high school, I think probably because I missed my teacher and other reasons. High school I went to the Piatti method (book 2), but I mustn't have studied it well because I'm doing book 1 now and already playing differently to how I was taught. It has been a lot of fun but there is a lot of practice. I never practiced as a child and was so uninterested with the sounds the instrument makes and the music I could play. The last music I remember studying at about 13-4 was Summertime and etudes from Piatti book 2. That was 22-3 years ago so that's why I sound like trash now...

Sorry for the huge amount of writing but I just wanted to pre-empt the whole get yr cello set up by a violin-family luthier and the get a teacher advice. In the new year I plan to seek lessons. Book 1 seems very manageable by myself if my skill improves over the next few months though. I'm revising a lot of the info in the all for strings books too. The yellow pages of book 1 made me feel very nostalgic ☺️ I don't like much of the music in those books however and prefer the etudes in the Piatti books. Is anyone familiar with the new school of cello by Percy Such and if that would be complimentary to what I'm doing? What should my learning pathway be? I printed the Dotzauer violoncelllo-schule but i don't like the finger markings, it doesn't look fun 😬 I asked the nice gentleman at the music shop some of this stuff but he told me that all the method books are the same and that the difference is the instruction given by the teacher.

I’m 15 and just started cello two years ago in 2018. And I would really love to get some advice from you guys. Please help!

1. Haydn Cello Concerto 1st movement in C Major 
- There’s a lot of mixed 32nd notes here and I’m really messed up and confused by them. I’ve come through a lot of different recordings on this piece from YouTube and I already know how the piece flows. But I don’t know how to count he rhythm easily in the simplest way. I do know 32nd notes mean 8 notes per beat but I don’t know how to combine all these mixed notes together. So I would like to know how you guys deal with counting these complicated rhythm when working on Haydn Concerto. I’ve heard a method that suggest to double up the rhythm, like make 32nd notes into 16th notes and 16th becomes 8th notes etc. And once u get used to it double up the tempo. But if I do it like that, I think I would never know how to count mixed or complicated 32nd notes ever. Can anybody tell me the simplest yet understandable way to count these rhythm?

2. Bach Prelude Suite 1
- I have some problems with crossing strings and pressing two notes simultaneously with the same fingering ( like B at A string and G at D strings) 
- I want to achieve a ringing clear sound when crossing strings especially from bar 31 until 35 where you have to constant cross between A and D string. 
- I would also like to know how to achieve a nice clear tone when playing many notes in a bow 
- From bar 39 to 41, when we are required to press notes prior on two strings. I feel like my pinky is straining. I have quite long but slim fingers. Any solutions for slim fingers cellists to avoid strained pinky?
- At bar 4 where we are required to press B on A string and G on D strings. I feel like there are squeaking sound when I cross strings and the same problem comes - my pinky will get a lil flat and I don’t think it’s good since I wasn’t told to have a C shape left hand shape since I start
- there’s some bars where I need to press two strings together (like E on D string and B on A string) . But it results that my first finger is flat and can’t produce a clear and rich sound. 

3. Tarantella by W.H Squire
- there are some double stops where some of them need to press notes and play D string simultaneously. I find it hard to achieve a clear sound too. Do I have to constantly change the angle slightly to play double stops?
- Same question on here is that how to play many notes that are slurred together in one bow ?

For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student. If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :)

Note that I will also be happy to continue hosting these meetings on a weekly basis as long as there is interest in them. I will always make a new post each week and add in the zoom details the day of the meeting. Time and day of the week will always be the same though.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where **mistakes are allowed**.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece.
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM BST**. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

I play a lot of cello gigs at Christmas Time and i'm looking for new arrangements to play. Preferably Cello/Piano, Cello/Organ, or Cello with choir and piano or organ. 

I have all of the basic Christmas books but i'm looking for more soloistic arrangements. I've been on the hunt for a while but I seem to only be finding the basic music. 

I have been making advanced arrangements up off of the basic arrangements but I would really like something written out so I can just hand it to a church music director and not have to explain it.

I'm an advanced player (fluent in thumb position) so nothing is really out of range. 

I'm specifically looking for an arrangement of O Holy Night but open to anything!

I tried googling some information but do not even know what I am looking for. My biggest question is, is it worth repairing for any reasons aside sentimental?

908,,1606344668,k12y25,"Hi, guys?
I'm 26 year old Canada immigrant, playing Viola at university.
I'm currently attending to the university in Vancouver as graduate student and just finished first term of first year.
I actually started learning viola very late, maybe at 20 or something, so it's been about 6 years since i started. I like playing viola, but I actually never practiced desperately or never spent like 6~8 hours for practicing in my life. I think the longest hours were like 4 or 5 hours, but average is 2~3 hours. Yet, i've been improving quite fast. Somehow, i finished my Bachelor degree and performance degree program at pretty popular music academy in Vancouver and currently attending to university as graduate student. Borrowing the words of my former and current professors, i have a great musicality and fast learning talent.

So, what i want to ask about? 
I'm just feeling like i'm on the edge of a breakdown. I just don't know what i should do after finishing my master degree program. I don't speak english fluently and never have any experience at teaching viola in English. What kind of parents would ask me to teach? Taking audition for professional orchestra? Yeah.. they won't take me. As i wrote above, i only have musicality as my talent. Most of Orchestra wants technique over musicality. I'm not trying to become a soloist or chamber musicians who are demanded to be musically talented. It is different story for orchestra players. Some of you may deny this fact, but it is truth that orchestra employers will look your technique over musicality. They want someone who can play every single notes accurately in tune over someone who play beautifully with messy tune. Also, there are too less chance to take an audition. I mean, do i have to wait until some old violist in orchestra retired or die to take an audition? 

I'm considsring if i should finish my master's degree program with this kind of shitty mindset, or should i just change my path to other career(non-music related) as soon as possible.",Cello,Tell me your think about my future career

916,,1606207681,k01feh,"Hello folks,

fairly recently I have started to self-teach some cello so that we/I can have some chamber music under corona conditions with the available friends. We form a quartet, but the others are, obviously, way beyond my level (we've played the Schubert octet together, with me on horn; both violins can do the first part in that, and the viola is almost on their level while considering the piano his primary instrument).

We've recently played Mozart's Divertimento No 1, KV 136, and they've been endlessly patient while I battle bow and stops into submission in this objectively really technically easy piece and said they rather enjoyed having the time to do the music justice while, for once, their cello did not complain about being bored.

Now the questions - are there other pieces in a similar vein, maybe a tad more difficult/involved, where the higher parts are not bored to tears yet I may still be able to carry my share? Ideally in a friendly key and with minimal, if any, shifting? Maybe even with the occasional empty string (do you call unstopped strings empty?) so I have a moment to compose myself, rest the left hand and acquire a new point of reference?

I've now had it for 15 years and it's still in good shape. I haven't played in years so I'm super rusty. I love the cello, its sound, and how it looks, just like I did when I was a kid, but I'm not sure if it still fits me since I'm now a hulking 5'2. If I remember correctly, I think it's a 3/4. It's a replica of Erlangen by Wilhelm Klier.

I have a budget of maybe up to $1,800. My cello was around $3,500. I made two appointments with luthiers near me to discuss a potential trade-in for a 7/8 or 4/4 cello if they fit better. I visited a luthier several months ago to get it appraised and he estimated it for around $1,300, which seemed kind of low to me, and I got the feeling I was being lowballed. I just sat down with my cello and it feels nice and comfortable, but I definitely have to reach a little more to reach the strings than I did when I was younger.

My questions are: Should I trade in for a new cello? How do I avoid being lowballed? And should I go back to Potter Violins to possibly trade in and buy?

946,,1605829569,jxe5nl,"Our next meetup will be **this Saturday, again at 8 PM Scottish time (GMT).** For those that haven't joined before: **Our meetups are supposed to be fun and super-casual.** Those that want to play and share some of the music they are currently working on, are welcome to do so. Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student. If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :)

Note that I will also be happy to continue hosting these meetings on a weekly basis as long as there is interest in them. I will always make a new post each week and add in the zoom details the day of the meeting. Time and day of the week will always be the same though.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where **mistakes are allowed**.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece.
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM BST**. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

My name is Andrew Ascenzo and I’m a cellist from Toronto Canada and I’ve been a member of the community here for a while using my other personal account. I wanted to share a project that I’ve been working on for the last little while. 

When the pandemic was declared in March and all of my performing work was cancelled, I was at a bit of a loss with what to do with my time those first few weeks. I decided to take on a little daily project to keep me occupied and playing until I knew more about what the coming weeks and months would look like, and came up with the idea of a project I called “Self-Isolation Bach.” I would record one movement of the Bach Suites a day and upload a video to Instagram to share with the world. It seemed easy at first but definitely got harder as I approached the 6th Suite!

Over the summer, I began a YouTube project called Pulse with my wife and music therapist SarahRose Black, where we would combine narratives of music and health with live performances and capture these in short video segments. As part of Pulse, we began to create videos reflecting on those early pandemic days when I was working my way through the suites. So far we have released two episodes called “The Secret of Bach’s Cello Suites” featuring the first two suites. If you are interested you can view them here:

Suite No. 1

Suite No. 2

959,Student,1605652761,jw3c20,"Hi! I have played cello for almost 10 years now and I started on a new piece with my teacher called Julie-O by Mark Summer. If you have played this piece before or are working on it right now, I have a few questions. I'm learning on the Carey Chaney arrangement of the piece, so if you learned on the original, there might be a few differences in measure numbers and rhythms than I'm learning.

I have played modern cello pieces before (Robin Hood Changes His Oil by Gideon Freudman is one of my favorites) but I've never played a piece like this one before. I'm not accustomed to some of the strange rhythms and pizzicato methods. I noticed this piece has a lot of strumming and left hand pizz and that is one of the problems I'm struggling with - I've done a bit of strumming before, but not as much as there is in this piece, and left hand pizz is pretty new to me. In particular, measures 39 - 49 are very hard for me to play, and I often get blisters on multiple fingers whenever I try playing it, especially on my right thumb. Any suggestions on how I can get through this section without destroying my fingers?

A specific measure that I am also having trouble with is measure 46 (with the alternating left and right hand pizz). I have practiced this one measure so much for the past couple weeks and yet I still don't seem to be making any progress on it. I can barely play it when I slow it down, and whenever I try to play it faster, it just falls apart. I have tried practicing it slowly and ramping up the tempo when I feel like I've gotten it down at a slower speed, but it doesn't seem to be helping much. I can play through the whole measure 39 - 49 section at tempo (despite the blisters) but this one measure screws me up every time. Am I doing something wrong? Is there another way I can try to learn this one measure?

Finally, I have also been a bit perplexed by the last page. I know its supposed to be similar to the beginning, but it sounds odd whenever I try to play it. My teacher has said that with the last page, you can basically improvise and do your own variation of what's written. I am absolute garbage at improvising with a piece, and I'm kinda stumped on what to do on the last page. I've listened to several recordings and the way the last page is played is always different for different recordings. It feels kind of intimidating or daunting whenever I decide to have a go at it, and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. Any ideas?",Cello,Julie-O by Mark Summer

Hello!

I have been playing cello for a year now and I have concerns I don’t seem to be able to improve.

- I press my thumb too much against the back of the neck. Even though my fingers are strong, i can’t seem to play if I don’t press my thumb. If I don’t press with my thumb I have the feeling that the cello wiggles around too much and I start making mistakes

- I have a lot of anxiety when I have to learn a new piece with my teacher. If I read a piece alone I take my time figuring it out but the “pressure” of learning a new piece in a new position (and sight reading in this new position) makes me feel super anxious because I feel “dumb” I don’t get it perfectly straight away. We still manage to go through the piece but I have the feeling it would be so much better without this anxiety. Just for the record; my teacher is nice and doesn’t judge/pressure me at all. It’s in my head.

- I am not a very sporty person, but I am young. That said, I am often exhausted after some minutes of practice, like playing the cello is some kind of cardio excercise for me. I am trying to be more “sporty” but I live in a cold country, I cannot jog for health reasons and I barely have space to excercise at home so I am working on that. 

- I travel a lot and it is not always possible to take my acoustic cello - any solution for this?

- Do you think it is too early to start jamming with other beginner musicians? 

What is a good practice routine for a beginners like me? I have heard about the suzuki books but I don’t know much about them, which one should I get first? I can play first position, lower first, extended first, lower second and upper second position.

If you can answer any of these questions thank you very much in advance &lt;3",Cello,Begginer concerns

I've played the cello for some years, but just now started recording it. I bought a Zoom H5 recorder, and recorded some guitar and vocal tracks with it, which turned out to sound quite nice.

But when I tried to mic the cello using the X/Y mic that came with the recorder, I kept getting some high frequency (approx. 5 to 14 kHz) noises that make me cringe every time. At first I thought it might be something with the room I was recording in (it was a really small room full of other stuff) or with the mic itself, but today I tried micking it using also a Shure Beta 58 mic in a bigger room, and got the same noise on the Zoom and Shure mics, no matter how they were positioned.

I recorded a sample on both microphones, here it is [with the Zoom mics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m_avPin2gKgASP58DZ1cd171lHAfY94m/view?usp=sharing) and [with the Shure one](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j-XirMr7IdPIb1zyDsz-wP1KSoY_J9BD/view?usp=sharing).

How exactly am I supposed to hold the bow? What should my bowing technique be like?",Cello,Beginner having trouble with how hold.

989,,1605133122,jshupo,"Our next meetup will be **this Saturday, again at 8 PM Scottish time (GMT).** For those that haven't joined before: **Our meetups are supposed to be fun and super-casual.** Those that want to play and share some of the music they are currently working on, are welcome to do so. Those that prefer to sit back and listen, are just as welcome! We tend to talk, laugh and share music, advice and the love for our instrument with ~~no~~ strings attached. For the most part we have so far been amateur players, with the youngest of us, in cello-age, only a couple of weeks or months into playing, quite a few adult beginners and the occasional music student. If you're curious, drop in! We'd be happy to have you. :)

Note that I will also be happy to continue hosting these meetings on a weekly basis as long as there is interest in them. I will always make a new post each week and add in the zoom details the day of the meeting. Time and day of the week will always be the same though.

**Please read all guidelines before joining:**

* The meetup will include brief introductions, less-brief chit-chat on everything ""cello"", and the (voluntary) performance of one piece of music. There will be time for friendly &amp; constructive feedback after each performance. Be nice, and remember that we are all life-long learners.
* Please keep pieces to a max of 5 min or shorter so that there is time for everyone to play.
* Any genre of repertoire is welcome.
* It's perfectly OK to perform a piece you are still learning / working on. It's also OK to perform the same piece you have performed already in a previous meeting to share the progress you've made.
* **The meeting is open to everyone of all skill levels and beginners are welcome.** You do not need to be a world class performer. Recognizing that performing can be extremely nerve racking, this is an opportunity for us all to learn to get comfortable playing in front of others in a more forgiving and positive environment where **mistakes are allowed**.

**Rules for Zoom:**

* Don't be a jerk.
* Use your reddit name or first name. Add ""(observer)"" to your name if you would like to participate without performing a piece.
* Come on time. The zoom meeting will be open 5 minutes before the start time and **will be locked at 8:10 PM BST**. Late comers will not be admitted so as not to interrupt performances and the flow of the meeting.
* Everyone's camera is required to be on for the sake of transparency and active participation.
* Mute your microphone during performances.
* Please watch this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb5dg98cSEM&amp;feature=youtu.be) on how to adjust zoom settings for optimal sound quality.

998,,1604942000,jr1nol,"hi, so i have a question. i am currently almost 15  yo, and i have been playing on a 3/4 cello for the past 4 years or so. i am short (about 155 cm or so) and tbh i dont know how much taller ill be in general.

my teacher say that there is no need to get a full sized cello for now, and maybe consider buying a 3/4 (my 3/4 is rented). i dont feel any discomfort in terms of size with this cello, so im wondering what do you think.

basically my question is, do you know any people who play on a 3/4 in their adult life? does it limit you as a cellist in any ways? just wondering, cause playing on a 3/4  (or at least a 7/8) might be the case for me cause i also have very small hands.

I would have to double check) and I also have a pretty cheap electric model (probably ~2-3 years old).

I’d like to take this opportunity to make a few announcements about several virtual orchestra groups. More cellists are always welcome to participate. Huge apologies for the repost, the old post had to be deleted because it was severely incomplete.

# What are these virtual orchestra groups like?

You can think of these groups as a remote community orchestra. It absolutely does not replace a real orchestral performance, but it certainly can replace sitting alone in our rooms, and we can do it without putting anyone's health at risk. All playing levels are accepted, and these projects and groups cover a wide difficulty range so you can pick and choose as you please. No, this is not a compensated gig. If you are a professional looking for work this is not it; the main demographic consists of amateurs and students. However, if you are bummed about the lack of work right now and want to keep up your chops or give something back to a musical community, you wouldn’t be the only one. All said, it’s a community orchestra.

The key operating principles of virtual orchestras are:

* You record your part in audio (or video) while listening to a click track in your headphones.
* The tracks are collected, edited, and mixed into a full orchestral performance and posted on YouTube (or another similar platform).

# Reddit Symphony Orchestra (r/theredditsymphony)

The RSO has a number of projects open for all musicians. More cellists are especially welcome. RSO runs a wide range of projects spanning a wide range of genres, ensemble groups and difficulty levels, so there should be something for everyone. Submissions are audio only.

[RSO’s youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/RedditSymphonyOrchestra).
Because the RSO has produced a great deal of fruit, here are few examples of projects they have done that have great significance in RSO's history and development. These projects span a wide range of styles and genres:

* [New World Symphony, 4th Movement](https://youtu.be/N0U6Wpc9kws)

* [Gerudo Valley](https://youtu.be/04aFYugYy9Q)

* [Barber: Adagio for Strings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOp-qtiQjKA)
* [Alex Lamotte: Countryside Rigadoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiAHtLLl-k)

All the project information can be found on r/theredditsymphony, and most of the current information is consolidated in a weekly information thread, which is made every Saturday.

# Current RSO Project List

Popular string ensemble piece, common with youth orchestras, should be familiar to many of you. Apologies, the click tracks are undergoing some fixes because the beats are not quite lined up properly. They will be fixed soon. Stay tuned. If you wish to record now, try to follow the audio to the best of your ability. This is NOT an issue with any of the other projects on this list.

1019,,1604530634,jo6yzd,"# Hey everyone,

I’d like to take this opportunity to make a few announcements about several virtual orchestra groups. More cellists are always welcome to participate. Apologies, this is a long post.

# What are these virtual orchestra groups like?

You can think of these groups as a remote community orchestra. It absolutely does not replace a real orchestral performance, but it certainly can replace sitting alone in our rooms, and we can do it without putting anyone's health at risk. All playing levels are accepted, and these projects and groups cover a wide difficulty range so you can pick and choose as you please. No, this is not a compensated gig. If you are a professional looking for work this is not it; the main demographic consists of amateurs and students. However, if you are bummed about the lack of work right now and want to keep up your chops or give something back to a musical community, you wouldn’t be the only one. All said, it’s a community orchestra.

The key operating principles of virtual orchestras are:
* You record audio (or video) while listening to a click track in your headphones.
* The tracks are collected, edited, and mixed into a full orchestral performance and posted on YouTube (or another similar platform).

# Reddit Symphony Orchestra (r/theredditsymphony)

The RSO has a number of projects open for all musicians. More new cellists are especially welcome. RSO runs a wide range of projects spanning a wide range of genres, ensemble groups and difficulty levels, so there should be something for everyone. Submissions are audio only.

[RSO’s youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/RedditSymphonyOrchestra).
Because the RSO has produced a great deal of fruit, here are few examples of projects we have done that have great significance in RSO's history and development. These projects span a wide range of styles and genres:

* [New World Symphony, 4th Movement](https://youtu.be/N0U6Wpc9kws)

* [Gerudo Valley](https://youtu.be/04aFYugYy9Q)

* [Barber: Adagio for Strings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOp-qtiQjKA)
* [Alex Lamotte: Countryside Rigadoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiAHtLLl-k)

All the project information can be found on r/theredditsymphony, and most of the current information is consolidated in a weekly information thread, which is made every Saturday.

# Current RSO Project List
* [Amy Beach: Gaelic Symphony 1st Movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditSymphony/comments/iwz0zg/amy_beach_symphony_in_e_minor_gaelic_community/) Due November 8. A little known orchestral work that imo deserves more attention. This is a very tough piece, one of the hardest RSO has ever done. Parts are very difficult. The deadline may be extended so stay tuned if you're interested. Great piece for those seeking a big challenge.
* [Flamingo](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditSymphony/comments/isa4n5/flamingo_for_concert_band_and_orchestra/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) Due November 14. How many shrimp?
* [Corelli: Christmas Concerto, first 3 movements](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditSymphony/comments/isa4n5/flamingo_for_concert_band_and_orchestra/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) Due November 21. Popular string ensemble piece, common with youth orchestras, should be familiar to many of you. Apologies, the click tracks are undergoing some fixes because the beats are not quite lined up properly. They will be fixed soon. Stay tuned. If you wish to record now, try to follow the audio to the best of your ability. This is NOT an issue with any of the other projects on this list.
* [Twilight Princess Symphonic Movement, from League of Legends](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditSymphony/comments/ji37gt/twilight_princess_symphonic_movement_project_17/) Due November 30. Celebrated piece from League of Legends.

 I´m Mattie from Reel Ear. I just wanted to let you know that we just released an amazing Melody Ear Training tool that will help you connect your cello playing directly with the music. You can also use it to improve your rhythm timing, intonation and long tones. Choose the musical variables that you want to work on, hit the play button and the app will give you random melodies based on your choices. Then, you play back what you hear.

We´ll be coming out with an arpeggio ear training app at the end of this month. There is a 15 day free trial. Come and visit us at [reelear.com](https://reelear.com/). We are musicians too and we are here to help you accelerate your music learning journey.",Cello,Ear Training For Cello
